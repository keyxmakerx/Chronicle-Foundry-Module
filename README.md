# Chronicle

**A self-hosted worldbuilding platform for tabletop RPG campaigns.**

Chronicle gives game masters and players a shared space to build worlds, track lore, manage calendars, visualize timelines, and run campaigns — all on your own server, with no paywall, no forced public content, and full control over your data.

## Why Chronicle?

Chronicle is purpose-built for tabletop RPGs, open source, and designed to be self-hosted from day one. No paywalls, no forced public content, no vendor lock-in — your world, your server, your data.

## Features

### Worldbuilding
- **Pages & Categories** — Create any content type (characters, locations, factions, items, etc.) with custom categories and dynamic field schemas
- **Rich Text Editor** — TipTap-powered WYSIWYG with @mentions, backlinks, GM secrets, and an insert menu
- **Relations** — Bi-directional entity relationships with typed connections ("is spouse of", "leads", "enemy of")
- **Entity Hierarchy** — Parent/child nesting with tree views and breadcrumb navigation
- **Tags** — Color-coded tags with DM-only visibility controls
- **Custom Attributes** — Per-category field templates (text, number, select, checkbox, URL) with per-entity overrides
- **Drag-and-Drop Page Layouts** — Visual layout editor for entity profile pages — no other tool has this

### Calendar & Time
- **Custom Calendars** — Define months, weekdays, moons, seasons, eras, and leap year rules for any fantasy calendar system
- **Real-Life Sync** — Optional Gregorian calendar mode synced to real-world dates
- **Events** — Single-day, multi-day, and recurring events with visibility controls, entity linking, and category icons
- **Import/Export** — Import from Simple Calendar, Calendaria, Fantasy-Calendar, or Chronicle JSON

### Timeline
- **Interactive D3 Visualization** — SVG-rendered timeline with zoom, pan, and minimap
- **Eras** — Named time periods with colored bars spanning year ranges
- **Standalone Events** — Calendar-free events for campaigns without formal calendars
- **Event Clustering** — Overlapping events automatically group for readability

### Maps
- **Leaflet.js Maps** — Upload custom map images and place interactive markers
- **Entity-Linked Markers** — Pin entities to map locations with click-through navigation
- **DM-Only Markers** — Hide map pins from players

### Game Sessions
- **Session Scheduling** — Plan game nights with date, location, and status tracking
- **RSVP** — Going / Maybe / Can't buttons with attendee tracking
- **Entity Linking** — Tag which pages were relevant to each session

### Campaign Management
- **Roles** — Owner (GM), Scribe (co-GM), and Player roles with granular permissions
- **Customizable Dashboards** — Drag-and-drop dashboard blocks (recent pages, calendar preview, timeline, maps, stats)
- **Customizable Sidebar** — Reorder, rename, and add custom navigation links
- **Category Dashboards** — Per-category landing pages with their own layouts
- **Public Campaigns** — Optionally make campaigns publicly viewable
- **"View as Player"** — Toggle to see your campaign as players see it

### Player Notes
- **Per-Entity Notes** — Private notes attached to any page
- **Shared Notes** — Share notes with the campaign (with edit locking)
- **Version History** — View and restore previous note versions
- **Checklists** — Quick checklist blocks within notes

### REST API
- **API v1** — Full CRUD for entities, calendar, events, maps, drawings, tokens, layers, fog, and media
- **API Key Auth** — Per-campaign API keys with read/write/sync permissions
- **Sync Protocol** — Sync mappings, WebSocket real-time events, and bidirectional Foundry VTT integration

### Admin & Security
- **User Management** — Admin dashboard for users, campaigns, storage, and security
- **Audit Logging** — Full activity trail for all campaign mutations
- **Rate Limiting** — Per-route rate limits on auth and upload endpoints
- **Session Security** — Redis-backed sessions with force-logout and session termination
- **IDOR Protection** — Campaign-scoped access checks on every route
- **Argon2id** — Password hashing with modern algorithm

---

## Foundry VTT Integration

Chronicle includes a Foundry VTT module for bidirectional sync between your Chronicle worldbuilding and your Foundry VTT game. Sync journals, maps (drawings, tokens, fog of war), and calendars in real-time.

**Install in Foundry VTT:**
```
https://github.com/keyxmakerx/Chronicle/releases/latest/download/module.json
```

Supports [Calendaria](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/calendaria) and [Simple Calendar](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/foundryvtt-simple-calendar) for calendar sync.

## Planned Features

- Per-entity permissions (view/edit per role)
- Relations graph visualization
- Editor tables
- Game system modules (D&D 5e SRD, Pathfinder 2e, Draw Steel)
- Campaign export/import
- Auto-linking (entity name detection in editor)
- Shop entity type with inventory management

See [.ai/todo.md](.ai/todo.md) for the full backlog.

## Quick Start

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/keyxmakerx/chronicle.git
cd chronicle

# Set required secrets
export SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
export DB_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your-root-password

# Start the full stack
docker compose up -d

# Chronicle is now running at http://localhost:8080
# The first user to register becomes the site admin.
```

### From Source

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.24+, Node.js (for Tailwind), MariaDB 10.11+, Redis 7+

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/keyxmakerx/chronicle.git
cd chronicle
cp .env.example .env       # Edit with your database credentials

# Start dependencies
make docker-up              # MariaDB + Redis via Docker

# Generate templates and CSS
make generate               # Runs templ generate + tailwindcss

# Run the server
make dev                    # Hot reload with air
# or
make run                    # Direct run
```

Database migrations run automatically on startup. The first user to register becomes the site admin.

## Development

```bash
make help            # Show all available commands
make dev             # Start dev server with hot reload (air)
make build           # Production binary build
make test            # Run all tests
make test-unit       # Unit tests only
make lint            # Run golangci-lint
make generate        # Regenerate Templ + Tailwind
make docker-up       # Start MariaDB + Redis
make docker-down     # Stop containers
```

### Architecture

Chronicle uses a **three-tier extension architecture**:

| Tier | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Plugin** | Feature app with handler/service/repo/templates | auth, campaigns, entities, calendar, maps |
| **Module** | Game system content pack (read-only reference data) | dnd5e, pathfinder |
| **Widget** | Reusable UI component (self-contained JS + API) | editor, tags, relations, notes |

Request flow: `Router → Middleware → Handler → Service → Repository → MariaDB`

See [.ai/architecture.md](.ai/architecture.md) for the full architecture document.

## Inspiration & Credits

Chronicle was developed with reference to several existing worldbuilding and note-taking platforms in the TTRPG space. We're grateful to the broader community for establishing patterns and conventions that inform what users expect from tools like these.

Notable platforms we studied during development include [World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/), [Kanka](https://kanka.io/), [LegendKeeper](https://www.legendkeeper.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). All design and code in Chronicle is original work.
