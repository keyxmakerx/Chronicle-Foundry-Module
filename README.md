# Chronicle

**A self-hosted worldbuilding platform for tabletop RPG campaigns.**

Chronicle gives game masters and players a shared space to build worlds, track lore, manage calendars, visualize timelines, and run campaigns — all on your own server, with no paywall, no forced public content, and full control over your data.

## Why Chronicle?

Existing tools either lock features behind paid tiers (World Anvil), rely on outdated editors (Kanka's Summernote), require cobbling together plugins for basic TTRPG features (Obsidian), or are closed-source (LegendKeeper). Chronicle is purpose-built for tabletop RPGs, open source, and designed to be self-hosted from day one.

**Inspired by** [World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/), [Kanka](https://kanka.io/), [LegendKeeper](https://www.legendkeeper.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) — taking the best ideas from each while avoiding their limitations.

## Features

### Worldbuilding
- **Pages & Categories** — Create any content type (characters, locations, factions, items, etc.) with custom categories and dynamic field schemas
- **Rich Text Editor** — TipTap-powered WYSIWYG with @mentions, backlinks, GM secrets, and an insert menu

- **Entity Hierarchy** — Parent/child nesting with tree views and breadcrumb navigation
- **Tags** — Color-coded tags with DM-only visibility controls
- **Custom Attributes** — Per-category field templates (text, number, select, checkbox, URL) with per-entity overrides
- **Drag-and-Drop Page Layouts** — Visual layout editor for entity profile pages — no other tool has this

### Calendar & Time
- **Custom Calendars** — Define months, weekdays, moons, seasons, eras, and leap year rules for any fantasy calendar system

### REST API
- **API v1** — Full CRUD for entities, calendar, and events
- **API Key Auth** — Per-campaign API keys with read/write/sync permissions

### Admin & Security
- **User Management** — Admin dashboard for users, campaigns, storage, and security
- **Audit Logging** — Full activity trail for all campaign mutations

## Planned Features

- Per-entity permissions (view/edit per role)
- Media browser for campaign owners
- Map layers, marker groups, and nested maps
- Relations graph visualization
- Editor tables and callout blocks
- Game system modules (D&D 5e SRD, Pathfinder 2e, Draw Steel)
- Campaign export/import
- Foundry VTT sync
- Auto-linking (LegendKeeper-style entity name detection)

See [.ai/todo.md](.ai/todo.md) for the full backlog.

## Quick Start

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/keyxmakerx/chronicle.git
cd chronicle

# Set required secrets
export SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
export DB_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your-root-password

# Start the full stack
docker compose up -d

# Chronicle is now running at http://localhost:8080
# The first user to register becomes the site admin.
```

### From Source

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.24+, Node.js (for Tailwind), MariaDB 10.11+, Redis 7+

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/keyxmakerx/chronicle.git
cd chronicle
cp .env.example .env       # Edit with your database credentials

# Start dependencies
make docker-up              # MariaDB + Redis via Docker

# Generate templates and CSS
make generate               # Runs templ generate + tailwindcss

# Run the server
make dev                    # Hot reload with air
# or
make run                    # Direct run
```

Database migrations run automatically on startup. The first user to register becomes the site admin.

## Development

```bash
make help            # Show all available commands
make dev             # Start dev server with hot reload (air)
make build           # Production binary build
make test            # Run all tests
make test-unit       # Unit tests only
make lint            # Run golangci-lint
make generate        # Regenerate Templ + Tailwind
make docker-up       # Start MariaDB + Redis
make docker-down     # Stop containers
```

### Architecture

Chronicle uses a **three-tier extension architecture**:

| Tier | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Plugin** | Feature app with handler/service/repo/templates | auth, campaigns, entities, calendar, maps |
| **Module** | Game system content pack (read-only reference data) | dnd5e, pathfinder |
| **Widget** | Reusable UI component (self-contained JS + API) | editor, tags, relations, notes |

Request flow: `Router → Middleware → Handler → Service → Repository → MariaDB`

See [.ai/architecture.md](.ai/architecture.md) for the full architecture document.

## Inspiration & Credits

Chronicle draws inspiration from the best in the TTRPG worldbuilding space:

- **[World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/)** — Guided worldbuilding prompts, deep secrets system, 45+ RPG system support. Chronicle aims for similar breadth with a cleaner UI and no paywall.
- **[Kanka](https://kanka.io/)** — Generous free tier, deep permissions, best-in-class calendar. Chronicle's calendar and permission model are influenced by Kanka's approach.
- **[LegendKeeper](https://www.legendkeeper.com/)** — Auto-linking, speed-first philosophy, beautiful maps. Chronicle aspires to LegendKeeper's polish and interaction depth.
- **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** — Plugin ecosystem, graph visualization, local-first philosophy. Chronicle's addon system aims to enable similar extensibility for TTRPG-specific features.
