## Upcoming Phases

### Phase V: Obsidian-Style Notes & Discovery ← CURRENT

_Quick capture, backlinks, enhanced graph, content templates, editor power-ups.
Priority: **Highest** — DM workflow & competitive parity with LegendKeeper/Obsidian.
See `.ai/obsidian-notes-plan.md` and `.ai/competitive-gap-analysis.md` for details._

#### Sprint V-1: Quick Capture, Session Journal & Slash Commands ✅

Quick-capture modal (Ctrl+Shift+N) creates a timestamped note instantly.
"Session Journal" button in topbar: append to today's journal entry. Add player
notes to Ctrl+K quick search results.

**Also:** TipTap slash command menu (`/` trigger). Commands: heading levels,
bulleted/numbered list, callout, table, image, horizontal rule, code block.
Inspired by LegendKeeper's `/secret`, `/layout`, `/help` pattern.

**Key files:** `static/js/widgets/editor_slash.js`, `static/js/quick_capture.js`,
`static/js/search_modal.js`, `static/js/widgets/notes.js`, topbar template

#### Sprint V-1.5: Inline Secrets / DM-Only Blocks in Editor (NEW)

Inline secret blocks within the TipTap editor — content visible only to
Owner/Scribe roles, hidden from Players. Rendered with a lock icon and subtle
border in edit mode. Stripped from HTML in read mode for unauthorized roles.

Competitive gap: World Anvil has inline secrets, LegendKeeper has `/secret`
blocks, Kanka has secret posts. Chronicle only has entity-level visibility
and DM-only posts — no inline content hiding within the main editor.

**Key files:** `editor.js` (custom TipTap node), `editor_secret.js`, `sanitize/`

#### Sprint V-2: Backlinks Panel & Entity Aliases

"Referenced By" section on entity show pages (layout block type). Query scans
`entry_html` for `data-mention-id` matching current entity. Collapsible panel
with source entity + context snippet. Redis caching.

**Also:** Entity aliases (migration: `entity_aliases` table). Multiple canonical
names per entity for auto-linking and search. Aliases appear in Ctrl+K results
and auto-linker name detection. Inspired by LegendKeeper's alias system.

**Key files:** entities repo/service/handler, `editor_autolink.js`, search

#### Sprint V-3: Content Templates

Pre-fill editor with structured content (e.g., Session Recap template with
headings). Template picker in entity create flow and editor insert menu.
Per-campaign or global. Owner-customizable.

**Key files:** migration, entities handler/templates, editor widget

#### Sprint V-4: Enhanced Graph View & Cover Images

Include @mention links in graph (not just explicit relations). Filter by entity
type, tag, search. Local graph view (N hops). Cluster by type/tag. Orphan
detection.

**Also:** Cover/banner images on entity pages as a layout block type. Currently
entities show a single avatar image. Add `cover_image` layout block that renders
a full-width hero banner at the top of the entity page. Inspired by World Anvil
and LegendKeeper's page headers.

**Key files:** `relation_graph.js`, layout block types, entity templates

---

### Phase W: Polish, Ecosystem & Delight

_Power-user features, map tools, integrations, bulk operations.
Priority: High — power users & map parity with LegendKeeper._

#### Sprint W-1: Command Palette & Saved Filters

Ctrl+Shift+P action palette with fuzzy search. Saved entity list filter presets
as sidebar links (`saved_filters` table).

#### Sprint W-2: Map Drawing Tools, Regions & Measurement

Leaflet.Draw integration (freehand, polygons, circles, rectangles, text). Uses
existing `map_drawings` table. Per-drawing visibility, color/opacity.

**Also (competitive gaps):**
- **Map regions / territory outlines** — polygon drawing with customizable fills,
  strokes, and labels. Inspired by LegendKeeper's region tool.
- **Map measurement / distance** — calibrate map scale, measure between points.
  Leaflet.Measure plugin or custom ruler tool.
- **Map embed layout block** — embed a mini-map in entity pages that auto-centers
  on the entity's marker. New layout block type `map_embed`.

#### Sprint W-2.5: Nested / Linked Maps (NEW)

Click a map marker to open a sub-map (world → region → city → dungeon). Map
markers gain an optional `linked_map_id` field. Breadcrumb navigation between
map levels. Both World Anvil and LegendKeeper have this — Chronicle maps are
currently flat.

**Key files:** migration (markers), maps handler/templates, `map_widget.js`

#### Sprint W-3: Discord Bot Integration

Plugin at `internal/plugins/discord/`. Bot token config. Webhook session
notifications. Reaction-based RSVP (ADR-012).

#### Sprint W-4: Bulk Operations & Persistent Filters

Multi-select entity lists with batch actions (tag, move, visibility, delete).
Persistent filters per category in localStorage.

**Also:** Entity tag/field filtering on entity list pages (currently only type
tabs exist). Filter by tag, custom field value, or visibility mode.

#### Sprint W-5: Editor Import/Export & Additional Themes

Markdown import/export via `goldmark`. Sepia + high-contrast themes. Custom
accent color picker.

**Also:** Embed media blocks in editor (video/audio URLs). World Anvil embeds
SFX and ambient audio — a simple URL embed block covers the gap.

#### Sprint W-6: Timeline List View & Meter Blocks (NEW)

**Timeline list view** — simple chronological list of events alongside the D3
visualization. LegendKeeper offers list/gantt/calendar views; a list view is
low-effort, high-value for scanning events quickly.

**Meter / tracker blocks** — layout block type for tracking numeric values
(HP, spell slots, ability scores). Configurable min/max, bar/circle/dot styles.
Inspired by LegendKeeper's meter block with 6 visualization styles.

---

### Phase T: Game Systems & Worldbuilding Tools

_Expand reference content and add worldbuilding aids.
Priority: Medium — content depth. T-0 through T-2 already complete._

#### Sprint T-3: Guided Worldbuilding Prompts

`worldbuilding_prompts` table with genre-aware writing prompts per entity type.
"Writing Prompts" collapsible panel on entity edit page. Default prompt packs
(fantasy, sci-fi, horror). Owner-customizable. Inspired by World Anvil's
worldbuilding meta tool.

**Key files:** migration, `entities/handler.go`, `entities/templates/`, `entities/service.go`

#### Sprint T-4: Entity Type Template Library

Genre presets (fantasy, sci-fi, horror, modern, historical) as JSON fixtures.
Campaign creation genre selection. "Import preset" in Customization Hub.

**Key files:** `campaigns/handler.go`, `campaigns/templates/`, fixture JSON files

---

### Phase U: Collaboration & Platform Maturity

_Multi-user collaboration, invites, security hardening, accessibility.
Priority: Medium — multi-user features._

#### Sprint U-1: Role-Aware Dashboards

Role-keyed dashboard layouts (Owner/Scribe/Player each see different dashboard).
Dashboard editor gains role selector dropdown. Players see role-specific or
default fallback.

#### Sprint U-2: Invite System

Migration: `campaign_invites` table (token, email, role, expires_at, used_at).
Email invitations with one-click accept link. Non-public campaigns require
invitation. Invite management UI on campaign settings page.

#### Sprint U-3: 2FA/TOTP

TOTP enrollment with QR code (`pquerna/otp`). Login redirect to TOTP input.
Recovery codes (8, hashed with argon2id). Admin force-disable.

#### Sprint U-4: Accessibility Audit (WCAG 2.1 AA)

ARIA labels, focus traps, skip-to-content, color contrast 4.5:1, keyboard nav,
screen reader live region announcements. axe-core scanning in CI.

#### Sprint U-5: Infrastructure & Deployment

Docker-compose full stack with health checks. Makefile full-stack target.
`CONTRIBUTING.md`. CI against docker-compose.

## Backlog (Address Opportunistically)

Items to pick up during related sprints or as standalone tasks. Full details
in `todo.md` under "Backlog" sections.

**UI Consistency:** Alert styling, admin pagination, modal standardization, rate
limiting on mutations, recurring calendar events (beyond yearly).

**Documentation:** Posts widget .ai.md, 16 JS widgets missing .ai.md.

**Player & DM Experience Gaps:** Entity tag/field filtering, print/PDF export,
share links, soft delete/archive, fog of war native UI,
initiative tracker, session prep checklist, NPC generator, account deletion,
activity tracking, timeline search/zoom-to-era, entity version history, toast
grouping, entity image gallery.

**Deferred / Community:** System Builder UI, Draw Steel system, whiteboards,
offline mode, collaborative editing, calendar timezones, map grids, webhooks,
Knowledge Graph addon, dice roller, family tree, cross-campaign search, mobile
modals, moons/seasons/weather in calendar, character sheets, combat tracker.
