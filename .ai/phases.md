## Upcoming Phases — Priority Order

### Phase 1: Foundry Completion & QoL ← START HERE

_Finish Foundry VTT sync so it's fully useful end-to-end. Generic system adapter
is the key unlock — without it, only D&D 5e and PF2e get character sync. QoL
sprints fill gaps that make the overall experience feel incomplete._

#### Sprint F-4.5: Generic System Adapter & Dynamic Matching

Remove hardcoded `SYSTEM_MAP` and adapter switch in Foundry module. Make ANY game
system (including custom-uploaded ones) work with character sync automatically.

**Deliverables:**
1. Add `foundry_system_id` field to system manifest schema — custom systems declare
   which Foundry system they're compatible with (e.g., `"foundry_system_id": "dnd5e"`)
2. Add `foundry_path` and `foundry_writable` annotations on character preset field
   definitions (e.g., `"foundry_path": "system.abilities.str.value"`)
3. New `GET /api/v1/systems/:id/character-fields` endpoint exposing field schema
   with Foundry path annotations to the Foundry module
4. New `generic-adapter.mjs` that reads field definitions from API and auto-generates
   `toChronicleFields()` / `fromChronicleFields()` mappings at runtime
5. `_detectSystem()` queries API and matches by `foundry_system_id` instead of static
   JS map. dnd5e/pf2e adapters remain as overrides for edge cases
6. Fields without `foundry_path` are read-only (pushed to Chronicle, not written back)

**Result:** Any custom-uploaded game system with a character preset and foundry_path
annotations gets automatic bidirectional character sync.

**Key files:** `internal/systems/manifest.go`, `foundry-module/scripts/sync-manager.mjs`,
`foundry-module/scripts/generic-adapter.mjs` (new), `internal/plugins/syncapi/api_handler.go`

#### Sprint F-QoL: Foundry Sync Diagnostics & Error Handling

Make the Foundry integration robust and debuggable for real-world use.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Validation report UI** — When uploading a custom system ZIP, show a detailed
   validation report (field count, category count, character preset detection,
   Foundry compatibility check) instead of just success/error
2. **System preview** — Preview what a system provides before enabling (categories,
   presets, field count, Foundry sync compatibility)
3. **Foundry sync health dashboard** — Expand existing sync dashboard with:
   connection uptime, last sync timestamps per entity type, error log with
   actionable messages, retry buttons for failed syncs
4. **Graceful error recovery** — When Foundry disconnects mid-sync, queue pending
   changes and retry on reconnect. Show queued change count in dashboard
5. **Field mapping debug view** — In Foundry module dashboard, show which Chronicle
   fields map to which Foundry paths, highlighting unmapped fields

**Key files:** `internal/systems/campaign_systems.go`, `internal/systems/custom_system.templ`,
`foundry-module/scripts/sync-manager.mjs`, Foundry dashboard templates

#### Sprint F-5: NPC Viewer / Hall

Campaign route `/campaigns/:id/npcs` — gallery/grid of revealed NPCs (non-private
character entities). Portrait, name, description, location, faction tags. Filters
by location/organization/relation. "Reveal" = DM toggles visibility. Foundry:
ownership change on NPC journal auto-reveals on Chronicle.

**Key files:** `internal/plugins/entities/`, new NPC templ views, `foundry-module/`

---

### Phase 2: System Modularity & Owner Experience

_Validate the full pipeline: owner uploads a custom game system → enables it →
gets reference data, tooltips, entity presets, Foundry sync, character sheets.
Ensure the system framework is truly modular and self-service._

#### Sprint X-1: System Upload UX & Validation

Polish the custom system upload experience so a non-technical owner can succeed.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Step-by-step upload wizard** — Replace bare file input with guided flow:
   (a) upload ZIP, (b) show parsed manifest summary (name, categories, presets,
   field count, Foundry compatibility), (c) confirm and install
2. **Manifest documentation page** — In-app help page or expandable section
   explaining manifest.json schema with annotated example. Link from upload UI
3. **Validation error detail** — On failure, show which specific check failed
   with a fix suggestion (e.g., "Missing `api_version` in manifest.json —
   add `\"api_version\": \"1\"` to the root object")
4. **Sample system download** — "Download sample system ZIP" button that provides
   a minimal working example (3-category, 1 preset, 5 reference items)

**Key files:** `internal/systems/campaign_systems.go`, `internal/systems/custom_system.templ`,
sample ZIP fixture

#### Sprint X-2: System-Provided Entity Presets & Auto-Setup

When a system with entity presets is enabled, automatically offer to create matching
entity types in the campaign.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Preset auto-detection on enable** — When owner enables a system addon, if
   the system has `entity_presets`, show a modal: "This system provides Character
   and Creature presets. Create matching entity types?"
2. **One-click entity type creation** — Each preset creates an entity type with
   the preset's fields, icon, and color pre-configured. Owner can skip or customize
3. **Preset sync on system update** — If owner re-uploads a system with changed
   presets, show diff and offer to update entity types (add new fields, don't
   remove existing ones to avoid data loss)
4. **Preset indicator on entity types** — Badge showing "From: D&D 5e" on entity
   types created from system presets. Link to system reference pages

**Key files:** `internal/plugins/addons/service.go`, `internal/plugins/entities/`,
`internal/systems/manifest.go`

#### Sprint X-3: System-Provided Widgets & Layout Blocks

Allow game systems to contribute UI widgets that appear in the template editor
palette and mount on entity pages.

**Deliverables:**
1. **System widget manifest entry** — New `widgets` array in manifest with widget
   name, JS file path, mount target, and config schema
2. **Widget JS bundling in system ZIP** — Allow `.js` files in system ZIPs (scoped
   to widget registration via `Chronicle.register()` pattern)
3. **Layout block registration** — System widgets appear as available block types
   in the template editor when the system is enabled
4. **Example: Stat Block widget** — D&D 5e system provides a `stat-block` widget
   that renders a formatted stat block from entity fields. Serves as reference
   implementation

**Key files:** `internal/systems/manifest.go`, `static/js/boot.js` (widget discovery),
`internal/widgets/dashboard_editor/`, system ZIP loader

#### Sprint X-4: System Debugging & Diagnostics

Give system authors and campaign owners tools to diagnose issues.

**Deliverables:**
1. **System status page** — `/campaigns/:id/systems/status` showing:
   enabled system, loaded categories, item counts per category, entity presets
   detected, Foundry compatibility status, any load warnings
2. **Reference data browser** — Browsable list of all reference items from the
   system (like the D&D 5e reference pages but auto-generated for any system)
3. **Tooltip preview** — Test tooltip rendering with sample data from the system
4. **Field mapping validator** — For systems with `foundry_path` annotations,
   show a table of field→Foundry path mappings with green/yellow/red status
   (mapped, read-only, unmapped)
5. **System error log** — Surface manifest parse warnings, data file issues,
   and runtime errors in the campaign settings UI

**Key files:** `internal/systems/`, new diagnostic templates, `internal/plugins/addons/`

#### Sprint X-5: Character Sheet Layout Blocks (Foundation)

First step toward character sheets — system-aware layout blocks that display
character data in a formatted sheet style.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Character sheet layout block type** — New block type `character_sheet` in
   template editor. Renders entity fields in a system-specific layout
2. **Default sheet templates** — D&D 5e and PF2e get styled character sheet
   layouts (ability scores grid, HP bar, class/level header)
3. **Field grouping** — Manifest presets gain optional `field_groups` for
   organizing fields into visual sections (e.g., "Abilities", "Combat", "Info")
4. **Editable inline** — Fields in the character sheet block are directly
   editable (click to edit, auto-save via attributes widget API)

**Key files:** `internal/systems/manifest.go`, `static/js/widgets/character_sheet.js` (new),
template editor block types, entity page templates

---

### Phase 3: Maps, Drawing & Spatial Features

_Bring Chronicle maps to parity with LegendKeeper. Drawing tools, nested maps,
regions, and measurement are the most-requested map features._

#### Sprint W-2: Map Drawing Tools, Regions & Measurement

Leaflet.Draw integration (freehand, polygons, circles, rectangles, text labels).
Uses existing `map_drawings` table. Per-drawing visibility, color/opacity. Map
regions with fills/strokes/labels. Measurement/distance tool. Map embed layout
block for entity pages.

**Key files:** `internal/plugins/maps/`, `static/js/widgets/map_widget.js`,
template editor block types

#### Sprint W-2.5: Nested / Linked Maps

Click a map marker to open a sub-map (world → region → city → dungeon). Markers
gain optional `linked_map_id` field. Breadcrumb navigation between map levels.

**Key files:** migration (markers), `internal/plugins/maps/`, `map_widget.js`

---

### Phase 4: Collaboration & Platform Polish

_Multi-user features, power tools, and platform maturity. Makes Chronicle ready
for teams and public instances._

#### Sprint U-1: Role-Aware Dashboards (finish)

Two-dashboard architecture already exists. Add role selector in dashboard editor
so Players/Scribes see role-specific campaign page layouts.

#### Sprint U-2: Invite System

`campaign_invites` table. Email invitations with one-click accept. Non-public
campaigns require invitation. Invite management UI on campaign settings page.

#### Sprint W-1: Command Palette & Saved Filters

screen reader live region announcements. axe-core scanning in CI.

#### Sprint U-5: Infrastructure & Deployment

Docker-compose full stack with health checks. `CONTRIBUTING.md`. CI against
docker-compose.

### Phase 5: Content Depth & Integrations

_Game system content, worldbuilding aids, external integrations._

#### Sprint T-3: Guided Worldbuilding Prompts

`worldbuilding_prompts` table. "Writing Prompts" panel on entity edit page.
Default packs per entity type (fantasy/sci-fi/horror). Owner-customizable.

#### Sprint T-4: Entity Type Template Library

Genre presets (fantasy, sci-fi, horror, modern, historical) as JSON fixtures.
Campaign creation genre selection. "Import preset" in Customization Hub.

#### Sprint W-3: Discord Bot Integration

Plugin at `internal/plugins/discord/`. Bot token config. Webhook session
notifications. Reaction-based RSVP (ADR-012).

#### Sprint W-5: Editor Import/Export & Themes

Markdown import/export via `goldmark`. Sepia + high-contrast themes. Custom
accent color picker. Embed media blocks (video/audio URLs).

#### Sprint W-6: Timeline List View & Meter Blocks

Chronological event list view alongside D3 viz. Meter/tracker layout block for
numeric values (HP, spell slots) with bar/circle/dot styles.

---

### Phase 6: Foundry Advanced & Economy

_Deep Foundry integration: inventory, shops, marketplace. Only after Phase 1
(generic adapter) is stable._

#### Sprint F-6: Armory / Inventory System

Items as entities with game-mechanic fields (weight, cost, rarity). Character
"Inventory" tab via entity relations with metadata (equipped, quantity, attunement).
System-specific item templates. Foundry Actor inventory sync.

#### Sprint F-7: Shop / Marketplace Enhancement
