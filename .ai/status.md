## Last Updated
2026-03-04 -- Production fix, mobile nav cleanup, dashboard widgets, Foundry completion (batch 20).
Branch: `claude/fix-production-logging-bwyeV`.

## Current Phase
**Production fix + Mobile nav + Dashboard widgets + Foundry completion.** Completed this session (batch 20):
- **Critical: Fixed duplicate migration 000041** — Two different migrations shared number
  000041 (session_recurrence_and_rsvp_tokens vs sync_mappings). Renumbered:
  sync_mappings→000044, map_expansion→000045, relation_metadata→000046. Production blocker resolved.
- **Mobile nav cleanup** — Removed all 3 addon sidebar links (Calendar, Maps, Timelines)
  from app.templ campaign navigation. Features now accessed via dashboard widgets.
- **Dashboard widgets** — Created 3 new interactive JS widgets (calendar_widget.js,
  timeline_widget.js, map_widget.js) auto-mounted by boot.js. Enhanced existing dashboard
  blocks with `data-widget` attributes. Added `map_preview` block type to dashboard editor.
- **Mobile responsive layouts** — Changed all dashboard/category/entity grids from fixed
  12-column to responsive (1-col mobile, 12-col desktop via `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-12`).
  Updated all colSpan helpers for responsive classes.
- **Foundry relations API** — Added GET `/entities/:entityID/relations` to sync API.
  Wired relations service into APIHandler. Shop widget fetches inventory via relations.
- **Foundry permission hardening** — Added `RequireAddonAPI` middleware gating calendar
  and map API routes behind addon enabled checks. Returns 404 for disabled addons.
- **Foundry E2E testing checklist** — Created comprehensive `foundry-module/TESTING.md`.

Previously completed (batch 19):
- Shop inventory widget + README cleanup

Previously completed (batch 16-18):
**Sessions-Calendar integration + RSVP system.** Completed (batch 16):
- **RequireAddon middleware**: Route-level addon gating for calendar, maps, sessions,
  timeline. Disabled addons now return 404/redirect instead of just hiding sidebar links.
- **Sessions merged into calendar**: Sessions sidebar link removed. Sessions now
  accessed via calendar header (dice icon). Sessions require calendar addon.
- **Sessions on calendar grid**: Real-life mode calendars display session chips
  (purple, dice icon) on their scheduled dates. Click opens inline session detail
  modal with RSVP controls (Going/Maybe/Can't).
- **Recurring sessions**: Weekly, biweekly, monthly, and custom N-week intervals.
  New DB columns: is_recurring, recurrence_type, recurrence_interval,
  recurrence_day_of_week, recurrence_end_date. Migration 000041.
- **Date formatting**: Session dates now display as "Mon, Jan 2, 2006" instead of
  raw ISO 8601 strings. FormatScheduledDate() helper on Session model.
- **SMTP HTML email**: Added SendHTMLMail with multipart/alternative MIME support
  (plain text + HTML variants). Existing SendMail unchanged.
- **RSVP email system**: Session creation auto-sends HTML invitation emails with
  one-click accept/decline links. Token-based (7-day expiry, single-use).
  Public /rsvp/:token endpoint for redemption — no login required.
- **Discord bot plan**: Documented in ADR-012. Future plugin at internal/plugins/discord/
  with reaction-based RSVP via bot token + webhook.
2026-03-04 -- Foundry VTT sync feature (batch 16, Phase 1+2 partial).
Branch: `claude/foundry-sync-feature-05M5a`.

## Current Phase
**Shop inventory widget + README updates.** Completed this session (batch 19):
- **Shop entity type**: New default entity type "Shop" seeded with field definitions
  (shop_type select, shopkeeper, currency, price_modifier). fa-store icon, orange color.
- **Relation metadata**: Added `Metadata` (JSON) field to Relation model, repository,
  and service. Migration 000043 column was already in DB — now wired end-to-end.
  New `PUT /entities/:eid/relations/:rid/metadata` endpoint for updating metadata.
  "sells"/"sold by" relation type pair added to common types.
- **Shop inventory widget** (`static/js/widgets/shop_inventory.js`): Self-contained
  JS widget that displays "sells" relations as inventory items with price, quantity,
  and in-stock controls. Search + add items UI. Auto-mounted on Shop entities via
  `data-widget="shop_inventory"`. Editable for Scribe+ roles.
- **Layout integration**: `blockShopInventory` templ block added. Auto-renders on
  Shop entities in fallback layout; available as `shop_inventory` block type in
  custom entity type layouts.
- **README cleanup**: Removed direct competitor comparisons (legal concern). Kept
  attribution as reference/inspiration. Added Foundry module manifest URL. Updated
  features and planned features lists.
- **Templ regeneration**: Fixed sessions handler build error (upstream merge had
  added userID param to templ but generated code was stale).

Previously completed (batch 18):
**Foundry VTT bidirectional sync:**
- **Map REST API v1** (batch 17): 23 new endpoints for maps, drawings, tokens, layers, fog
  CRUD. Authenticated via API keys with read/write permission levels.
- **Calendar live sync** (batch 18, Phase 4):
  - New `PUT /calendar/date` API endpoint for absolute date setting (used by Calendaria
    and SimpleCalendar which send `{year, month, day}` instead of relative `{days: N}`).
  - New `CalendarService.SetDate()` method with validation and WebSocket event publishing.
  - Complete rewrite of `foundry-module/scripts/calendar-sync.mjs` with adapter pattern
    supporting **both Calendaria and SimpleCalendar**. Handles date sync, event CRUD
    (create/update/delete), and initial calendar structure sync on connect.
  - Fixed date sync mismatch: Foundry module was sending absolute dates to `POST /advance`
    (which expects relative days). Now correctly uses `PUT /calendar/date`.
  - Added `onInitialSync()` lifecycle hook — SyncManager calls it after WebSocket connect.
  - Event mapping persistence via Foundry user flags (`chronicle-sync.calendarEventMappings`)
    for bidirectional event ID tracking between Calendaria/SimpleCalendar and Chronicle.
  - SimpleCalendar support: 0-indexed month/day conversion, `addNote()` for event creation,
    `simple-calendar-date-time-change` hook for date sync.

Previously completed (batch 16):
- WebSocket hub infrastructure (`internal/websocket/`): hub, client, message types,
  multi-authenticator (API key + session cookie), EventBus interface.
- Sync mapping service: CRUD for `sync_mappings` table tracking Chronicle↔Foundry
  document ID relationships with version tracking.
- Foundry VTT module skeleton (`foundry-module/`): 8 JS modules (api-client, sync-manager,
  journal-sync, map-sync, shop-widget, calendar-sync, settings, module entry point),
  templates, styles, lang, module.json manifest.
- Map data model expansion: migrations 000042 (layers, drawings, tokens, fog tables +
  grid/fog columns on maps table) and 000043 (relation metadata for shop inventory).
- Drawing/Token/Layer/Fog CRUD: full service, repository, and REST API handler with
  role-based visibility filtering, IDOR protection, percentage-based coordinates.
- Wired everything into app routes.go with adapter patterns to avoid circular imports.

Previously completed (batch 15):
- Entity link hover fix + codebase review

Previously completed (batch 14):
- Temporary storage limit bypass system for admin panel

Previously completed (batch 13):
- Bug fixes + QoL media browser enhancements

Previously completed (batch 12):

Previously completed (batch 11):
- Security hardening: audit logging, concurrent upload limits, disk space checks, orphan cleanup

Remaining from approved media plan:
- Part 5e: Media usage indicator in browser (pre-computed reference counts)

Completed (batch 9):
- Campaign-scoped media browser:
  - New page at `/campaigns/:id/media` (Owner-only)
  - Grid view with thumbnails, file info overlay on hover, lazy image loading
  - "Referenced by" tracking: queries entities by `image_path` and `entry_html` content
  - HTMX lazy-loaded reference fragments per file

  - Upload from browser page (Alpine.js uploader with validation)
  - Storage stats header (file count, total bytes used)
  - Pagination for large media libraries (24 per page)
  - Sidebar "Media" link in Manage section (Owner-only, between Activity Log and Customize)
  - Repository: `FindReferences()` via UNION query on entities
  - Service: `ListCampaignMedia()`, `GetCampaignStats()`, `FindReferences()`, `DeleteCampaignMedia()`
  - Routes: `RegisterCampaignRoutes()` function for campaign-scoped media management

Completed (batch 8):
- Customizable calendar event categories (migration 000039, settings tab, dynamic dropdown)

Completed (batch 7):
- Search scope expanded: Ctrl+K now searches entities, timelines, maps, calendar events, and sessions
- Editor callout blocks: blockquote restyled as callout with accent border, background, info icon

Previously completed (batches 1-6):
- Fixed sidebar drill 403, unsaved changes warning, confirmation dialogs, timeline eras
- HTMX loading indicator, empty states, calendar click-to-create, event detail view
- Keyboard shortcuts help, sessions discoverability, form validation feedback
- Entity cloning, mobile sidebar toggle (already done), timeline event creation (already done)
- Map marker search
- All 294+ tests passing

Completed (batch 4):
- Keyboard shortcuts help overlay (press `?`, Mac-aware ⌘/Ctrl)
- Sessions addon discoverability (cross-link in calendar header)
- Form validation feedback (CSS `:user-invalid` red borders, inline error hints)

Completed (batch 5):
- Entity cloning (Clone button, service method, CopyEntityTags repo, audit logging)
- Map marker search (client-side filter + pan-to-match on Enter)
- Verified: mobile sidebar toggle already implemented, timeline event creation already implemented

**Next priorities:**
1. Media management for campaign owners
2. Editor tables + callout blocks (requires TipTap bundle rebuild)
3. Search scope expansion (calendar events, timelines, maps, sessions)
4. Calendar event categories customization

### HTMX Sidebar Conversion + JS Hoisting Fixes — COMPLETE
Branch: `claude/review-codebase-R1WqN`
1. **JS hoisting bug fixes** — Removed local `var` aliases for Chronicle.escapeHtml/
   escapeAttr/getCsrf in 10 JS files. Replaced all call sites with direct Chronicle.*
   calls, eliminating the var hoisting bug class permanently.
2. **HTMX sidebar drill-down** — Converted sidebar from 238 lines of JS HTML-building
   to server-rendered Templ fragments. New `SidebarDrillPanel` component, `SidebarDrill`
   handler + route (`GET /campaigns/:id/sidebar/drill/:slug`). Server-side auto-drill
   on page load when URL matches a category.
3. **sidebar_drill.js rewrite** — 238 → 95 lines. Zero escapeHtml/escapeAttr usage.
   Only handles CSS class toggling + htmx.ajax() triggers.
4. **Latent search bug fixed** — Sidebar search was passing `type_slug` (ignored by
   SearchAPI handler); now passes `type` (numeric entity type ID) for correct filtering.
5. **Script load order fixed** — sidebar_drill.js now loads after boot.js in base.templ.

### Code Quality Sprint — COMPLETE
Branch: `claude/improve-timeline-ui-e1R9X`
1. **golangci-lint v2 config** — Updated `.golangci.yml` for v2 compatibility (version
   field, removed typecheck/gosimple linters).
2. **Fixed all 138 lint issues:**
   - 126 errcheck: added exclusion rules for idiomatic defer patterns, fixed real bugs
     (unchecked json.Unmarshal, Row.Scan, rand.Read)
   - 11 staticcheck S1016: simplified struct conversions in calendar/campaigns/entities
   - 1 unused: removed dead `scanTimeline` function from timeline repository
3. **JS utility consolidation:** `escapeHtml` (9 copies), `escapeAttr` (7 copies),
   `getCsrf` (3 copies) replaced with shared `Chronicle.escapeHtml`, `Chronicle.escapeAttr`,
   `Chronicle.getCsrf` in `boot.js`. 11 widget files updated.
4. **syncapi repository** — Proper error handling for 6 Row.Scan calls and 5
   json.Unmarshal calls in stats/key scanning methods.

### Alpha Documentation Sprint — COMPLETE
1. BUG-0 fix (public campaign 403s), todo.md restructure, roadmap.md update
2. 6 new `.ai.md` documentation files (media plugin, 5 JS widgets)

### Remaining Alpha Priorities
- Debug image upload click handler (BUG-1)
- Tag visibility controls — per-tag `dm_only` flag (BUG-3)
- Attributes "Reset to Template" button (BUG-4)
- Campaign-scoped media browser for owners (BUG-2)
- `RequireAddon` API middleware for graceful extension degradation
- Add golangci-lint + security scanning to CI pipeline
- Increase test coverage (currently 5.3%)
- ClamAV file scanning integration

### Timeline Phase 2 — COMPLETE
Branch: `claude/improve-timeline-ui-e1R9X`
1. Center spine ruler — horizontal ruler line at vertical center with 3-tier ticks
   (primary/secondary/tertiary) replacing top-only axis
2. Rich grid — alternating column bands + major/minor grid lines
3. Calendar era background bands — semi-transparent colored rects with watermark labels
   (CalendarEraLister adapter, handler returns eras in data API)
4. Range event bars — multi-day events as horizontal colored bars (end_year/end_month/
   end_day added to EventLink, SQL, scan)
5. Event clustering — at era/century zoom, overlapping events collapse to count badges
6. Category event icons — Font Awesome glyphs replace dots for categorized events
7. Mini-map overview strip — 36px strip below SVG with viewport indicator + click-to-jump
8. Toolbar polish — visible year range indicator (Y{left} – Y{right})

### Timeline Phase 1 — COMPLETE (commit `0667e55`)
Branch: `claude/fix-refresh-glitch-ybWmN`
1. SVG layout fix — dynamic content height, clip path padding
2. Day-level text fix — foreignObject cards with line-clamp, category badges
3. Alpine Collapse plugin — downloaded vendor JS, loaded before Alpine core
4. Loading skeleton — pulsing placeholder bars while D3 loads
5. Clickable zoom buttons — segmented Era|Cen|Dec|Year|Mon|Day group
6. Event detail panel — floating panel on click with full event info
7. Unified tabbed view — single card with "Visualization" / "Event List" tabs

### Timeline Phase 2B — FUTURE
- Event connections/relationships (draw links between related events)
- Create-from-timeline workflow (create new events directly from viz)
- Additional polish and animations

### Environment Notes
- `templ` binary at `/root/go/bin/templ` — run `export PATH="$PATH:/root/go/bin"` first
- `tailwindcss` NOT installed in this environment — run `make tailwind` locally
- Build cycle: `templ generate && go build ./... && go test ./...`

### Migration ENUM Bug Fix — COMPLETE
- **Root cause**: Migrations 000027 (calendar) and 000029 (maps) used `INSERT INTO
  addons ... category='plugin'` but `'plugin'` was not in the ENUM. Secondary issue:
  slugs 'calendar' and 'maps' already existed from migration 000015's seed data,
  causing duplicate key conflicts hidden behind the ENUM error.
- **Fix**: Migration 000027 now ALTERs the ENUM to add `'plugin'` before any
  INSERT/UPDATE. Both 000027 and 000029 use UPDATE (not INSERT) to modify existing
  addon rows. Down migrations revert to original 000015 values instead of deleting.
- **Go code**: Added `CategoryPlugin` constant to `model.go`, added `'plugin'` to
  `validCategories` in `service.go`.
- **Safeguards**: Created `internal/database/migrate_test.go` with tests that scan
  migration SQL for invalid ENUM values. Added Migration Safety Rules to conventions.
  Added protective comments to migration 000015. Recorded ADR-017.
- **Files changed**: `000027_calendar_plugin.{up,down}.sql`,
  `000029_maps_plugin.{up,down}.sql`, `000015_create_addons.up.sql` (comment),
  `addons/model.go`, `addons/service.go`, `database/migrate_test.go` (new).

## Phase E: Entity Hierarchy & Extension Bug Fix (2026-02-24)

### Extension Enable Bug Fix — COMPLETE
- **Root cause**: Admin panel allowed activating planned addons (Calendar, Maps, Dice Roller)
  that have no backing code. Once activated, campaign owners could "enable" them — nothing
  would happen because the code doesn't exist.
- **Fix**: Added `installedAddons` registry in `service.go` — a `map[string]bool` listing
  slugs with real backing code (currently only `"sync-api"`).
- **Service layer**: `UpdateStatus()` blocks activating uninstalled addons. `EnableForCampaign()`
  blocks enabling uninstalled addons. `List()` and `ListForCampaign()` annotate `Installed` field.
- **Admin UI**: Uninstalled addons show "Not installed" label and disabled activate button.
- **Campaign UI**: Uninstalled addons show "Coming Soon" badge instead of enable/disable toggle.
- **Model**: Added `Installed bool` to both `Addon` and `CampaignAddon` structs (not persisted).
- **Tests**: 5 new tests (TestIsInstalled, TestUpdateStatus_ActivateInstalled,
  TestUpdateStatus_ActivateUninstalled, TestEnableForCampaign_NotInstalled,
  TestListForCampaign_AnnotatesInstalled). All 32 addon tests pass.

### Entity Hierarchy — COMPLETE (4 Sprints)

**Sprint 1: Data Plumbing**
- Added `ParentID` to `CreateEntityRequest`, `UpdateEntityRequest`, `CreateEntityInput`,
  `UpdateEntityInput` in `model.go`.
- Added `FindChildren`, `FindAncestors`, `UpdateParent` to `EntityRepository` interface.
- `FindAncestors` uses recursive CTE with depth limit of 20.
- Service: parent validation (exists, same campaign, no self-reference, circular reference
  detection by walking ancestor chain of proposed parent).
- 8 new hierarchy tests, all passing.

**Sprint 2: Parent Selector on Forms**
- `form.templ`: Added `parentSelector` component — Alpine.js searchable dropdown using
  existing entity search endpoint (`Accept: application/json` header).
- Pre-fill parent from `?parent_id=` query param ("Create sub-page" flow).
- Edit form pre-populates current parent with "Clear" button.
- `EntityNewPage` and `EntityEditPage` accept `parentEntity *Entity` parameter.

**Sprint 3: Breadcrumbs + Children + Create Sub-page**
- `show.templ`: Breadcrumb now shows ancestor chain (furthest first, immediate parent last).
  Each ancestor is a clickable link.
- `blockChildren` component: sub-pages section with card grid + "Create sub-page" button
  linking to `/campaigns/:id/entities/new?parent_id=:eid&type=:typeID`.
- Handler `Show()` fetches ancestors via `GetAncestors()` and children via `GetChildren()`.

**Sprint 4: Tree View on Category Dashboard**
- `category_dashboard.templ`: Third view toggle (grid/table/tree) with localStorage persistence.
- `EntityTreeNode` struct + `buildEntityTree()` builds tree from flat entity list using parent_id.
- `entityTreeLevel` recursive templ component: collapsible nodes with expand/collapse chevrons,
  entity icon/name links, privacy indicators, child count badges, indented border-left nesting.

### Editor Insert Menu — COMPLETE
- Added `+` button to editor toolbar that opens a dropdown with discoverable insertions.
- Menu items: Mention Entity (Type @), Insert Link, Horizontal Rule (---),
  Blockquote (>), Code Block (```). Each shows shortcut hint.
- "Mention Entity" inserts `@` at cursor and triggers the mention popup.
- "Insert Link" prompts for URL and wraps selection or inserts link text.
- Extensible for future features (secrets, embeds, etc.).
- Files: `editor.js` (createInsertMenu, executeInsert), `input.css` (dropdown styles).

### Backlinks / "Referenced by" — COMPLETE
- **Repository**: `FindBacklinks()` searches `entry_html` for `data-mention-id="<entityID>"`
  pattern using LIKE query. Returns up to 50 results, respects privacy by role.
- **Service**: `GetBacklinks()` delegates to repo with error wrapping.
- **Handler**: `Show()` fetches backlinks and passes to template.
- **Template**: `blockBacklinks` component renders a "Referenced by" section with
  entity type icon/name chips, styled as pill links. Only shown when backlinks exist.
- **Tests**: 1 new test (TestGetBacklinks_DelegatesToRepo). All 39 entity tests pass.

### Entity Preview Tooltip Enhancement — COMPLETE
- **Migration 000023**: Added `popup_config` JSON column to entities table.
- **Model**: `PopupConfig` struct with `ShowImage`, `ShowAttributes`, `ShowEntry` booleans.
  `EffectivePopupConfig()` returns entity config or defaults (all true).
- **Preview API**: Enhanced `GET /entities/:eid/preview` to include attributes (up to 5
  key-value pairs from entity type fields) and respect popup_config visibility toggles.
- **Popup Config API**: New `PUT /entities/:eid/popup-config` saves per-entity preview settings.
- **Tooltip Widget**: Enhanced `entity_tooltip.js` with side-by-side layout (gradient-bordered
  image on left + type badge/name/attributes on right), entry excerpt below, dynamic layout
  adapting based on available data.
- **Edit Form**: "Hover Preview Settings" collapsible section with checkboxes for
  Show Image / Show Attributes / Show Entry. Auto-saves via API with inline status feedback.
  Clears tooltip cache after save so changes are immediately visible.

### Admin Security Dashboard — COMPLETE
- **Migration 000024**: `security_events` table + `is_disabled` column on users table.
- **Security Event Logging**: Site-wide event log tracking logins (success/failed), logouts,
  password resets (initiated/completed), admin privilege changes, user disable/enable,
  session terminations, and force logouts.
- **Active Sessions View**: Admin can see all active sessions (user, IP, client, created time)
  with ability to terminate individual sessions.
- **User Account Disable**: Admin can disable user accounts (blocks login, destroys all sessions).
  Disabled users see "your account has been disabled" on login attempt. Cannot disable admins.
- **Force Logout**: Admin can force-logout all sessions for any user.
- **Session IP/UA Tracking**: Login sessions now record client IP and User-Agent for the
  active sessions view and security event context.
- **Dashboard Integration**: Security card on admin dashboard shows failed login count (24h).
  Security nav link added to admin sidebar.
- **Auth Integration**: Auth handler fires security events on login success/failure, logout,
  password reset initiation/completion. Login checks is_disabled before password verification.
- **Files**: `security_model.go`, `security_repository.go`, `security_service.go`,
  `security.templ` (new). Modified: `handler.go`, `routes.go`, `dashboard.templ`, `users.templ`,
  `auth/model.go`, `auth/service.go`, `auth/handler.go`, `auth/repository.go`,
  `layouts/app.templ`, `app/routes.go`.

### Sidebar Drill-Down Rework — COMPLETE
- **Zone-based layout**: Sidebar reorganized into 4 zones: global nav (top),
  campaign context with drill-down (middle), manage (bottom), admin (bottom).
- **Static sections**: Manage, Admin, Dashboard, All Campaigns, and Discover
  remain fixed during category drill-down — only categories area transforms.
- **Overlay approach**: Replaced 2-panel slider with absolute-positioned overlay
  that slides from right with paper-style box-shadow effect.
- **Icon-only collapse**: When drilled in, categories collapse to 48px icon strip
  with gradient shadow pseudo-element for depth effect.
- **Files**: `app.templ` (sidebar restructure), `sidebar_drill.js` (overlay logic),
  `input.css` (replaced `.sidebar-peek` with `.sidebar-icon-only` + `.sidebar-cat-active`).

### Customize Page Restructure — COMPLETE
- **Dashboard tab**: Now uses full-page flex layout matching Page Templates tab.
  Header text constrained to `max-w-3xl`, editor fills remaining space.
- **Categories tab**: 2-column desktop layout (identity left `md:w-80`, category
  dashboard right `flex-1`). Stacks on mobile. Attributes card removed.
  Width expanded to `max-w-5xl` for 2-column room.
- **Files**: `customize.templ` (dashboard/categories/extensions tabs),
  `entity_type_config.templ` (category fragment restructure).

### Extensions — Notes, Player Notes & Attributes — COMPLETE
- **Notes addon rename**: Migration 000026 renames "player-notes" to "notes" (the
  floating notebook widget). "player-notes" re-added as separate planned addon for
  future entity-page collaborative notes with real-time editing.
- **installedAddons**: `"notes"` and `"attributes"` are installed; `"player-notes"`
  is planned (not installed, no backing code yet).
- **Attributes addon**: Migration 000025 registers "attributes" addon in DB.
  Added to `installedAddons`. New `EntityTypeAttributesFragmentTmpl` template
  and `EntityTypeAttributesFragment` handler for HTMX lazy-loading.
  Extensions tab shows category selector that loads field editor per category.
- **Entity show**: Respects attributes addon enabled state. `AddonChecker`
  interface on Handler, wired via `SetAddonChecker()` in routes.go.
- **Tests**: Updated `TestIsInstalled` for both addons. All 32+ addon tests pass.

### Keyboard Shortcuts — COMPLETE
- Global shortcuts: Ctrl+N (new entity), Ctrl+E (edit entity), Ctrl+S (save).
- IIFE pattern matching `search_modal.js`. Suppresses shortcuts in inputs (except Ctrl+S).
- Save priority: `#te-save-btn` → `.chronicle-editor__btn--save.has-changes` → `form .btn-primary` → `chronicle:save` event.
- Files: `static/js/keyboard_shortcuts.js`, `base.templ` (script tag).

### Calendar Plugin Sprint 1 — COMPLETE
- **Migration 000027**: 6 tables (`calendars`, `calendar_months`, `calendar_weekdays`,
  `calendar_moons`, `calendar_seasons`, `calendar_events`). Registers "calendar" addon.
- **Model**: Domain types + DTOs. `Moon.MoonPhase()` and `MoonPhaseName()` for phase
  calculation. `Calendar.YearLength()` sums month days.
- **Repository**: Full CRUD, transactional bulk-update for sub-resources, event listing
  with recurring event support and role-based visibility filtering.
- **Service**: Validation, one-calendar-per-campaign, date advancement with month/year rollover.
- **Handler**: Setup page (create form), monthly grid view, API endpoints for settings/events/advance.
  Seeds 12 default months (30 days) and 7 default weekdays on create.
- **Templates**: `CalendarSetupPage`, `CalendarPage`, monthly grid with weekday headers,
  day cells, event chips, moon phase icons, month navigation.
- **Routes**: Owner (create, settings, advance), scribe (events), public (view).
- **Wiring**: Added to `app/routes.go` and `installedAddons` registry.

### Calendar Plugin Sprint 2 — COMPLETE
- **Migration 000028**: Leap year fields (`leap_year_every`, `leap_year_offset` on calendars,
  `leap_year_days` on months), season `color`, event end dates (`end_year`, `end_month`,
  `end_day`), event `category`, device fingerprint (`device_fingerprint`, `device_bound_at`
  on api_keys).
- **Leap years**: `IsLeapYear()`, `YearLengthForYear()`, `MonthDays()` all account for
  per-month leap year extra days. `AdvanceDate` is leap-year-aware.
- **Seasons**: `Color` field, `ContainsDate()` with wrap-around support, `SeasonForDate()`
  method, season color borders on calendar day cells.
- **Events**: Multi-day events (EndYear/EndMonth/EndDay), event categories (holiday, battle,
  quest, birthday, festival, travel, custom) with category icons.
- **Calendar settings page**: 5-tab page (General, Months, Weekdays, Moons, Seasons) with
  Alpine.js list management, JSON serialization for x-data attributes, fetch-based saves.
  Accessible via gear icon on calendar header (Owner only).
- **Event creation modal**: Alpine.js + fetch form with name, description, date, visibility,
  category, entity link, recurring flag. Quick-add button on day cell hover.
- **Entity-event reverse lookup**: HTMX lazy-loaded section on entity show pages. Calendar
  plugin serves fragment at `GET /calendar/entity-events/:eid`.
- **Sync API calendar endpoints**: Full REST API for external tools (Foundry VTT). GET/POST/
  PUT/DELETE for calendar, events, months, weekdays, moons. Advance date endpoint.
- **Device fingerprint binding**: Auto-bind on first `X-Device-Fingerprint` header, reject
  mismatches with 403 + security event logging. `BindDevice`/`UnbindDevice` on service.

### Calendar Plugin Sprint 3 — COMPLETE
- **Sidebar link**: Calendar icon link in Zone 2 (campaign context), between Dashboard
  and Categories. Gated behind `IsAddonEnabled(ctx, "calendar")`, active state highlighting.
- **Dashboard block**: `calendar_preview` block type for campaign dashboard editor. HTMX
  lazy-loaded from `GET /calendar/upcoming?limit=N`. Shows current date, season, and
  upcoming events with category icons, entity links, and date formatting.
- **Timeline view**: `GET /calendar/timeline?year=N` chronological event list grouped by
  month. Year navigation, view toggle between grid and timeline on calendar header.
  Timeline events show description, entity link, multi-day range, visibility badges.
- **New service methods**: `ListUpcomingEvents()`, `ListEventsForYear()` on service interface.
- **New repo method**: `ListUpcomingEvents()` with combined date comparison + recurring
  event handling.
- **Files**: `app.templ` (sidebar link), `campaigns/model.go` + `dashboard_blocks.templ`
  (block type), `dashboard_editor.js` (palette), `calendar/handler.go` (2 new handlers +
  TimelineViewData), `calendar/service.go` (2 new methods), `calendar/repository.go`
  (ListUpcomingEvents query), `calendar/calendar.templ` (5 new components),
  `calendar/routes.go` (2 new routes).

### Calendar Plugin Sprint 4 — COMPLETE
- **Dual-purpose event modal**: Transformed create-only modal into create/edit modal.
  Hidden `event_id` field triggers PUT (edit) vs POST (create). Title, submit button
  text/icon dynamically switch between modes.
- **Clickable event chips**: Scribe+ users see event chips as `<button>` elements with
  `data-event-*` attributes. Clicking opens the edit modal pre-filled with all event fields.
  Players still see static `<div>` chips.
- **Delete with confirmation**: Delete button visible only in edit mode. Clicking shows
  a confirmation overlay within the modal (hides the form, shows warning + confirm/cancel).
  DELETE request sent on confirm, page reloads on success.
- **Helper function**: `derefStr()` for safe nil string pointer dereferencing in templates.

### Maps Plugin Phase 1 — COMPLETE
- **Migration 000029**: `maps` table (id, campaign_id, name, description, image_id FK,
  image_width, image_height, sort_order) + `map_markers` table (id, map_id, name,
  description, x/y percentage coords, icon, color, entity_id FK, visibility, created_by).
  Addon registered as `maps` in addons table.
- **Model**: Map, Marker structs with DTOs. MapViewData, MapListData for templates.
- **Repository**: Full CRUD for maps and markers. Entity LEFT JOIN for display data.
  Visibility filtering by role (role >= 3 sees dm_only).
- **Service**: Validation, default icon/color, coordinate clamping (0-100), CRUD.
- **Handler**: Index (map list), Show (Leaflet viewer), CRUD APIs for maps and markers.
  Form-based map creation + JSON APIs.
- **Templates**: Map list page with card grid + create modal. Leaflet.js map viewer
  with CRS.Simple for image overlay. Marker create/edit modal with icon picker,
  color picker, visibility, entity linking. Map settings modal with image upload.
  Delete confirmation for markers (in-modal) and maps (confirm dialog).
- **Leaflet features**: Draggable markers (Scribe+) with silent PUT on dragend.
  Place mode (crosshair cursor, click to place). Tooltip on hover, popup for players.
  DM-only markers hidden from players via server-side filtering.
- **Wiring**: Added to `installedAddons`, `app/routes.go`, sidebar nav, admin plugin registry.

### Phase H: Inline Secrets — COMPLETE
- **TipTap secret mark**: `editor_secret.js` creates a `secret` mark via
  `TipTap.Underline.extend()`. Renders as `<span data-secret="true" class="chronicle-secret">`.
  Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+S`. Toolbar button with eye-slash icon.
- **Editor integration**: SecretMark added to extensions array. Toolbar button in
  text formatting group. Active state tracking. Insert via toolbar or keyboard shortcut.
- **Server-side stripping**: `sanitize.StripSecretsHTML()` regex-strips secret spans from
  HTML. `sanitize.StripSecretsJSON()` walks ProseMirror JSON tree and removes text nodes
  with secret marks. Applied in `GetEntry` handler when `role < RoleScribe`.
- **Sanitizer whitelist**: `data-secret` attribute allowed on `<span>` in bluemonday policy.
- **CSS styling**: Amber background tint, dashed bottom border, eye-slash pseudo-element
  indicator. Visible to owners/scribes, invisible to players (server-stripped).

### Documentation Audit — COMPLETE
- **calendar/.ai.md**: Created missing plugin documentation (architecture, data model,
  routes, design decisions, sync API integration).
- **data-model.md**: Added migrations 24-29 (security_events, attributes addon,
  notes addon rename, 6 calendar tables, maps + map_markers). Updated ER diagram
  and indexes section.
- **architecture.md**: Updated directory structure with calendar plugin, maps plugin,
  sanitize package, new JS files (editor_secret, keyboard_shortcuts, search_modal,
  sidebar_drill, dashboard_editor, sidebar_nav_editor, notes). Updated plugin list.
- **tech-stack.md**: Leaflet.js marked as active (was "Phase 2").
- **decisions.md**: ADR-015 (Maps with percentage coords + Leaflet CRS.Simple),
  ADR-016 (Inline secrets via TipTap Mark extension).
- **editor/.ai.md**: Added editor_secret.js to files table, secret mark to current
  state checklist, inline secrets documentation to notes section.

### Entity Page 500 Fix — COMPLETE
- **Root cause**: `scanEntity()` in `repository.go` selected 22 columns (including
  `e.popup_config`) but only had 21 `Scan()` targets — `popup_config` was missing.
  The Go SQL driver returned `"expected 22 destination arguments in Scan, not 21"`
  for every `FindByID`/`FindBySlug` call, breaking all entity detail pages.
- **Why it was silent**: Raw `fmt.Errorf` from the SQL driver bypassed both
  `AppError` and `echo.HTTPError` checks in the error handler, falling through to
  the default 500 case. The old error handler had blind spots that didn't log these.
- **Fix**: Added `popupRaw` to the `scanEntity` scan targets and unmarshal logic,
  matching the already-correct `scanEntityRow` (used by list queries).
- **Also fixed**: Error handler now logs ALL 5xx errors (not just AppErrors with
  Internal != nil). Calendar HTMX lazy-load gated behind addon check.
- **Files**: `entities/repository.go` (scanEntity), `app/app.go` (error handler),
  `entities/handler.go` (showCalendar gate), `entities/show.templ` (conditional render).

### Calendar Block Support — COMPLETE
- **Dashboard**: `calendar_preview` block already existed in dashboard editor palette.
  Fixed route auth: moved `/calendar/upcoming` and `/calendar/entity-events/:eid` from
  RequireAuth group to AllowPublicCampaignAccess group (matching `/calendar` and
  `/calendar/timeline`). HTMX lazy-loads from the dashboard use OptionalAuth.
- **Category dashboards**: Added `calendar_preview` block type to category block palette
  (`categoryDashboardBlockTypes()`) and `CategoryBlockSwitch` renderer (`catCalendarPreview`).
- **Entity pages**: Added `calendar` block type to template editor palette and
  `entityBlockInner` renderer (`blockCalendarEvents`). Uses `layouts.IsAddonEnabled`
  for addon gating. `layoutHasBlock` helper skips hardcoded bottom section when block
  is placed in the layout to avoid duplicates.
- **Customize page**: Added calendar settings info section to Extensions tab showing
  where to add calendar blocks across the three layout editors.
- **Files**: `calendar/routes.go`, `campaigns/customize.templ`, `entities/show.templ`,
  `entities/category_blocks.templ`, `entities/entity_type_config.templ`,
  `static/js/widgets/template_editor.js`.

### Calendar Plugin Sprint 5 — Time System — COMPLETE
- **Migration 000030**: Added time columns to `calendars` (hours_per_day, minutes_per_hour,
  seconds_per_minute, current_hour, current_minute) and `calendar_events` (start_hour,
  start_minute, end_hour, end_minute). All nullable/defaulted for backwards compatibility.
- **Model**: Calendar gets HoursPerDay, MinutesPerHour, SecondsPerMinute, CurrentHour,
  CurrentMinute fields. Event gets StartHour, StartMinute, EndHour, EndMinute (*int, nullable).
  Helper methods: FormatCurrentTime(), HasTime(), FormatTime(), FormatEndTime(),
  FormatTimeRange(), IsMultiDay(). All DTOs updated with time fields.
- **Repository**: All scan/insert/update queries updated for new columns. Event listing
  now sorts by date AND time (COALESCE for null time = sort last).
- **Service**: AdvanceTime() method with minute→hour→day rollover. CreateCalendar defaults
  to 24/60/60 time system. All CRUD methods pass time fields through.
- **Handler**: AdvanceTimeAPI endpoint (POST /calendar/advance-time). UpdateCalendarAPI,
  CreateEventAPI, UpdateEventAPI all accept time fields.
- **Settings UI**: General tab now has Current Hour/Minute inputs, Time System section
  (hours/day, minutes/hour, seconds/minute). Save button sends all time fields.
- **Event modal**: "Set specific time" checkbox reveals start/end time picker (hour:minute
  inputs). Edit mode restores time from data attributes. Reset clears time fields.
- **Calendar grid**: Event chips show time prefix (e.g. "14:30 Meeting") when HasTime().
  Data attributes carry time fields for edit roundtrip.
- **Calendar header**: Shows FormatCurrentTime() next to season indicator.
- **Dashboard preview**: Shows current time alongside current date.
- **Timeline view**: Shows FormatTimeRange() on events with times.
- **Entity events**: Shows time range next to event date.
- **Sync API**: All event endpoints (create/update) accept time fields. Settings endpoint
  accepts time system fields. GetCurrentDate returns hour/minute. AdvanceTime endpoint added.
- **Routes**: advance-time route on both internal and sync API.
- **Files**: migration 000030, model.go, repository.go, service.go, handler.go, routes.go,
  calendar.templ, calendar_settings.templ, syncapi/calendar_api_handler.go, syncapi/routes.go.

### Calendar Plugin Sprint 6 — Calendar Modes + Timezone — COMPLETE
- **Migration 000031**: Added `mode` VARCHAR(20) to calendars (fantasy/reallife),
  `timezone` VARCHAR(50) to users.
- **Two calendar modes**: Fantasy (full customization, existing behavior) and Real-Life
  (Gregorian months/weekdays, synced to wall clock via user timezone).
- **Model**: `ModeFantasy`/`ModeRealLife` constants, `IsRealLife()` method, `Mode` field
  on Calendar and CreateCalendarInput.
- **Repository**: `mode` column in all calendar scan/insert queries.
- **Service**: Mode validation in CreateCalendar (defaults to "fantasy" if not "reallife").
- **Handler CreateCalendar**: Mode-aware creation — real-life seeds Gregorian months (correct
  day counts including Feb 28+1 leap), Gregorian weekdays (Sun–Sat), current date/time from
  `time.Now().UTC()`, epoch "AD", leap year every 4. Fantasy seeds generic 12×30 months.
- **Setup page redesign**: Three mode cards (Real Life / Custom Fantasy / Import Coming Soon)
  with Alpine.js mode selection. Each mode opens its own form with appropriate fields.
- **Settings page**: Months/Weekdays tabs hidden for real-life mode. Date/time/time-system/
  leap-year fields hidden for real-life mode. Info box shown instead explaining Gregorian sync.
- **User timezone**: Added `Timezone *string` to User model. Updated FindByID, FindByEmail,
  ListUsers to scan timezone. Added `UpdateTimezone` to UserRepository and AuthService.
  Validates IANA timezone via `time.LoadLocation()`.
- **Account page**: New `GET /account` settings page with timezone dropdown (curated list
  of ~65 IANA timezones). `PUT /account/timezone` API for saving. Account link added to
  app header navigation next to Logout.
- **Sync API**: GetCurrentDate response includes `mode` field. GetCalendar already returns
  full struct with mode.
- **Files**: migration 000031, calendar/model.go, repository.go, service.go, handler.go,
  calendar.templ, calendar_settings.templ, auth/model.go, auth/repository.go, auth/service.go,
  auth/handler.go, auth/routes.go, auth/account.templ (new), auth/service_test.go (mock fix),
  layouts/app.templ (account link), syncapi/calendar_api_handler.go.

### Sessions Plugin (Sprint 7) — COMPLETE
- **Migration 000032**: `sessions` table (id, campaign_id, name, summary, notes/notes_html,
  scheduled_date, calendar_year/month/day, status, sort_order, created_by), `session_attendees`
  table (session_id, user_id, status RSVP, responded_at), `session_entities` table (session_id,
  entity_id, role). Addon registered as "sessions".
- **Model**: Session, Attendee, SessionEntity structs with DTOs. Status constants (planned,
  completed, cancelled). RSVP constants (invited, accepted, declined, tentative). Entity role
  constants (mentioned, encountered, key).
- **Repository**: Full CRUD for sessions, attendees (upsert via ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE),
  entity linking. ListByCampaign sorts planned first, then by scheduled_date.
- **Service**: Validation (name required, max 200 chars), CRUD orchestration, InviteAll for
  batch attendee invites, UpdateRSVP with status validation, entity linking with role defaults.
- **Handler**: MemberLister interface for cross-plugin campaign member access. All HTTP handlers
  with IDOR protection (requireSessionInCampaign). Auto-invites all campaign members on create.
  HTMX-aware RSVP responses (returns AttendeeList fragment or JSON).
- **Templates**: Session list page with status grouping (Upcoming/Completed/Cancelled), detail
  page with attendee list and RSVP buttons (Going/Maybe/Can't), create modal with name/date/summary.
- **Wiring**: Added to app/routes.go, installedAddons, sidebar nav (dice-d20 icon).
- **Files**: migration 000032, sessions/model.go, repository.go, service.go, handler.go,
  routes.go, sessions.templ, sessions/.ai.md (new). Modified: app/routes.go, addons/service.go,
  layouts/app.templ.

### Eras, Weather & Setup Wizard (Sprint 8) — COMPLETE
- **Migration 000033**: `calendar_eras` table (name, start_year, end_year, description,
  color, sort_order). Added `weather_effect` VARCHAR(200) column to `calendar_seasons`.
- **Model**: Era struct with IsOngoing(), ContainsYear() methods. Calendar.Eras field,
  Calendar.CurrentEra(), Calendar.EraForYear() helpers. Season.WeatherEffect field.
  EraInput DTO.
- **Repository**: SetEras/GetEras (same bulk pattern as other sub-resources). Season
  scan/insert updated for weather_effect column.
- **Service**: SetEras validation (name required, end >= start), color defaults.
  eagerLoad includes eras.
- **Handler**: UpdateErasAPI (PUT /calendar/eras). CreateCalendar redirects fantasy
  mode to settings page for immediate customization (real-life still goes to grid).
- **Templates**: 6th tab "Eras" in settings page (name, start/end year, color,
  description). Weather effect field added to seasons editor. Era indicator shown in
  calendar header, timeline header, and dashboard preview (landmark icon + era name
  with era color). Season weather effect shown alongside season name (middot separator).
  Enhanced fantasy setup form with post-creation guidance grid showing all customizable
  features.
- **Sync API**: Added PUT /api/v1/campaigns/:id/calendar/eras endpoint.
- **Files**: migration 000033, calendar/model.go, repository.go, service.go, handler.go,
  routes.go, calendar.templ, calendar_settings.templ, syncapi/calendar_api_handler.go,
  syncapi/routes.go, calendar/.ai.md.

### Calendar Import/Export (Sprint 9) — COMPLETE
- **export.go** (NEW): Chronicle native export format (`chronicle-calendar-v1`).
  `ChronicleExport` envelope with calendar config + optional events. `BuildExport()`
  constructs export from fully-loaded Calendar struct.
- **import.go** (NEW): Auto-detection and parsing of 4 calendar JSON formats.
  `DetectAndParse()` inspects top-level JSON keys: `"format"` for Chronicle,
  `"calendar"` for Simple Calendar v1, `"exportVersion"+"calendars"` for SC v2,
  `"static_data"+"dynamic_data"` for Fantasy-Calendar, `"days.hoursPerDay"` or
  months-as-object for Calendaria. Format-specific parsers handle: 0-indexed→1-indexed
  conversion (SC), localization key stripping (Calendaria), day-of-year→month+day
  conversion (Calendaria seasons), `{values: {...}}` nesting (Calendaria), SC v1
  legacy field aliases, leap day accumulation (Fantasy-Calendar).
- **service.go**: Added `ApplyImport()` (destructive replacement of all sub-resources)
  and `ListAllEvents()` (owner-visibility for export).
- **handler.go**: 4 new handlers: `ExportCalendarAPI` (GET, JSON download),
  `ImportCalendarAPI` (POST, multipart or JSON, 10MB limit, preview mode),
  `ImportPreviewAPI` (POST, preview without applying), `ImportFromSetupAPI` (POST,
  creates new calendar + applies import + auto-enables addon).
- **routes.go**: 4 new routes (all Owner only).
- **syncapi**: `ExportCalendar` and `ImportCalendar` methods on CalendarAPIHandler.
  Routes: `GET /calendar/export` (read), `POST /calendar/import` (write).
- **calendar.templ**: Setup page import card now functional with file upload form
  (multipart, CSRF, supported formats list).
- **calendar_settings.templ**: Export download button in settings header.

### Rich Text Event Descriptions (Sprint 10) — COMPLETE
- **Migration 000034**: `ALTER TABLE calendar_events ADD COLUMN description_html TEXT`
- **model.go**: Added `DescriptionHTML *string` to Event struct and input DTOs.
  Added `HasRichText()` and `PlainDescription()` helper methods.
- **repository.go**: Updated eventCols, scanEvents, CreateEvent, UpdateEvent to
  include description_html column.
- **service.go**: Added `sanitize.HTML()` call in CreateEvent and UpdateEvent for
  rich text HTML. Imported sanitize package.
- **handler.go**: Both CreateEventAPI and UpdateEventAPI accept `description_html` in
  JSON request bodies.
- **syncapi/calendar_api_handler.go**: Both apiCreateEventRequest and
  apiUpdateEventRequest accept `description_html`.
- **export.go**: ExportEvent includes `description_html` for round-trip fidelity.
- **calendar.templ**: Replaced textarea with inline TipTap editor in event modal.
  Editor supports @mentions via Chronicle.MentionExtension. Editor initialized lazily
  on modal open, content stored as ProseMirror JSON + rendered HTML. Modal widened to
  max-w-lg. Timeline renders rich HTML via `templ.Raw()` with plain text fallback.
  Tooltip uses PlainDescription() for clean display.

### Calendar V2 Plan — FULLY COMPLETE
All 6 sprints (5-10) are complete:
- Sprint 5: Time System
- Sprint 6: Calendar Modes + Timezone
- Sprint 7: Session Scheduling + RSVP
- Sprint 8: Eras, Weather & Setup Wizard
- Sprint 9: Calendar Import/Export
- Sprint 10: Rich Text Event Descriptions + @Mentions

### Code Review & Hardening — COMPLETE
- **Sessions IDOR fix**: `LinkEntityAPI` now verifies entity belongs to the same campaign
  as the session via `EntityCampaignChecker` interface, preventing cross-campaign IDOR.
- **Secret regex fix**: Added `(?s)` dotall flag to `secretSpanRe` for multiline matching.
  Fixed misleading comment about nested tag handling.
- **Settings validation**: `UpdateStorageSettings` now validates ParseFloat/Atoi results
  instead of silently defaulting to 0 (which means "no limit").
- **Calendar visibility**: `UpdateEvent` now validates visibility field (same rules as
  `CreateEvent`), preventing arbitrary visibility values via API.
- **Entity repo consistency**: Fixed 3 ignored `json.Unmarshal` errors on PinnedEntityIDs
  and 13 ignored `RowsAffected()` errors throughout `entities/repository.go`.
- **Calendar handler refactor**: Moved ~150 lines of seeding logic (Gregorian/fantasy
  months, weekdays, time system defaults) from handler to service. Handler now follows
  "thin handler" convention.
- **Entity handler**: Added `slog.Warn` for previously unchecked `GetEntityTypes` and
  `CountByType` service errors.
- **Editor memory leak**: Insert menu global click listener now stored and removed in
  widget `destroy()` to prevent leaks during HTMX re-mounts.
- **Template editor**: `JSON.parse` calls wrapped in try-catch with fallback defaults.
- **Notes widget**: Added `.catch()` handler to create note promise chain.
- **Dashboard editor**: Fixed validation mismatch (prompt said 4-12, code allowed 1-50).
- **Follow-up**: Fixed missed `json.Unmarshal` error check in `ListByCampaign` (double-tab
  indentation wasn't caught by `replace_all`). Fixed `seedDefaults` to preserve
  `cal.Description` in the `UpdateCalendar` call (was silently nulling it out).
- **Files changed**: sessions/{service,handler}.go, sanitize/sanitize.go, settings/handler.go,
  calendar/{service,handler}.go, entities/{repository,handler}.go, app/routes.go,
  editor.js, template_editor.js, notes.js, dashboard_editor.js, .ai/status.md.

### Timeline Plugin Sprint 1 — COMPLETE
- **Migration 000035**: 4 tables (`timelines`, `timeline_event_links`,
  `timeline_entity_groups`, `timeline_entity_group_members`). Addon updated from
  planned/widget to active/plugin.
- **Model**: Timeline, EventLink, EntityGroup, EntityGroupMember structs with DTOs.
  VisibilityRules JSON struct for per-user visibility overrides. Zoom level constants
  (era, century, decade, year, month, day). EffectiveLabel/EffectiveColor helpers.
- **Repository**: Full CRUD for timelines, event links, entity groups. Calendar name
  JOIN, event count subquery, entity display data JOINs. Role-based visibility filter.
- **Service**: Validation (name, icon, color, visibility, zoom), CalendarLister interface
  for calendar selector dropdown, CRUD orchestration.
- **Handler**: Thin handlers with IDOR protection (requireTimelineInCampaign). Index,
  Show, CreateForm, UpdateAPI, DeleteAPI, LinkEventAPI, UnlinkEventAPI, TimelineDataAPI,
  ListCalendarsAPI. HTMX fragment support.
- **Routes**: Owner (create, update, delete, calendar list), Scribe (link/unlink events),
  Player (view list, view timeline, data API). Public-capable views via OptionalAuth.
- **Templates**: List page with card grid + create modal (Alpine.js calendar selector).
  Show page with event list (Sprint 1 static, Sprint 3 D3.js). Event cards with date,
  color bar, entity link, category badge, unlink button.
- **Calendar integration**: calendarListerAdapter in app/routes.go wraps CalendarService
  for the timeline create form dropdown. User-selected calendar_id FK. Forward-compatible
  with future multi-calendar support.
- **Wiring**: Added to app/routes.go, installedAddons, sidebar nav (fa-timeline icon).
- **Files**: migration 000035 (up/down), timeline/{model,repository,service,handler,
  routes,timeline.templ,.ai.md} (all new), app/routes.go, addons/service.go,
  layouts/app.templ.

### Timeline Plugin Sprint 2 — Calendar Event Linking — COMPLETE
- **CalendarEventLister interface**: Cross-plugin adapter for reading calendar events
  without importing the calendar repo. `calendarEventListerAdapter` in app/routes.go wraps
  `CalendarService.ListAllEvents()`, maps to `CalendarEventRef` struct, and filters by
  visibility role.
- **Service methods**: `ListAvailableEvents` fetches all calendar events from the timeline's
  calendar, filters out already-linked event IDs, returns unlinked events. `LinkAllEvents`
  bulk-links all available events in a single call.
- **Handler endpoints**: `ListAvailableEventsAPI` (GET .../available-events) for event picker
  data, `LinkAllEventsAPI` (POST .../events/all) for bulk linking.
- **Routes**: 2 new Scribe-level routes added to authenticated group.
- **Event picker modal**: Alpine.js-powered modal on timeline show page. Fetches available
  events from API, renders searchable list with date/name/entity/category, click-to-link
  with immediate removal from list. Search filters by name, entity name, or category.
- **Header buttons**: "Add Events" (opens picker modal) and "Add All" (bulk-link with
  confirmation) buttons for Scribe+ users. Delete button styled with red text for Owner.
- **Files**: service.go (CalendarEventLister, CalendarEventRef, ListAvailableEvents,
  LinkAllEvents), handler.go (2 new handlers), routes.go (2 new routes), timeline.templ
  (event picker modal, header buttons), app/routes.go (calendarEventListerAdapter),
  .ai.md (updated routes/docs).

### Timeline Plugin Sprint 3 — D3.js Interactive Visualization — COMPLETE
- **D3.js loaded per-page**: CDN-loaded D3 v7 on timeline show pages only (matching
  Leaflet per-page pattern from maps plugin). No bundle bloat for other pages.
- **timeline_viz.js widget**: Self-contained Chronicle widget (`data-widget="timeline-viz"`)
  that renders an interactive SVG timeline:
  - Horizontal time axis with year-level default zoom
  - Event markers positioned by fractional year (year + month/12 + day/365)
  - d3.zoom for pan/drag/scroll-zoom (horizontal only)
  - Color-coded events (per-link color_override or timeline default)
  - Entity group swim-lanes with alternating background bands
  - Tooltips on hover (name, date, entity, category, description excerpt)
  - Event labels shown/hidden based on zoom level
- **Toolbar**: Zoom in/out buttons, zoom-fit (all events), zoom level indicator
  (Era/Century/Decade/Year/Month/Day), skip-to-year input.
- **CSS**: Full dark-theme styling in input.css (toolbar, SVG elements, tooltip,
  empty state). Uses CSS custom properties matching Chronicle's theme system.
- **Template changes**: Static event list replaced with D3 widget mount point.
  Event list preserved as collapsible `<details>` section below visualization.
- **Files**: static/js/widgets/timeline_viz.js (new), static/css/input.css
  (timeline-viz styles), timeline.templ (D3 script tags, widget mount, collapsible list).

### Timeline Plugin Sprint 4 — Zoom Levels and Search — COMPLETE
- **Zoom-level visual styles**: 6 distinct visual configurations (era→day), each with
  different marker radius, stroke width, label/date/entity visibility. Markers smoothly
  transition between sizes via D3 transitions on zoom level change.
- **Zoom-level-aware axis**: Tick formatting adapts per level — years at era/century/decade,
  months at month level, individual days at day level.
- **Category indicator dots**: Small colored dots next to event markers showing category
  color (holiday=amber, battle=red, quest=green, birthday=pink, etc.).
- **Search/filter bar**: Text input in center of toolbar. Filters events in real-time:
  matching events stay full opacity with highlight ring, non-matching dim to 15% opacity.
  Searches across name, entity, category, description, and year. Clear button to reset.
- **Enhanced date/entity sub-labels**: Additional text elements on events showing
  month/day (at month+ zoom) and entity name (at day zoom) for fuller context.
- **Files**: static/js/widgets/timeline_viz.js (enhanced), static/css/input.css
  (search bar, date/entity label styles).

### Timeline Plugin Sprint 5 — Entity Groups and Swim-Lanes — COMPLETE
- **Entity group CRUD handlers**: CreateEntityGroupAPI, UpdateEntityGroupAPI,
  DeleteEntityGroupAPI, ListEntityGroupsAPI — all Owner-only with IDOR protection
  via requireTimelineInCampaign.
- **Group member management**: AddGroupMemberAPI (with entity_id validation),
  RemoveGroupMemberAPI — Owner-only routes.
- **parseIntParam helper**: Extracts integer path parameters (:gid) with 400 error
  on non-numeric input.
- **Routes**: 7 new Owner-only routes under `/campaigns/:id/timelines/:tid/groups/...`
  for full group and member lifecycle.
- **Template**: entityGroupsSection Alpine.js component on timeline show page with:
  create group form (name + color), group list with member chips, entity search for
  adding members, inline delete for groups and members. Only visible to Owner role.
- **Files**: handler.go (7 new handlers + parseIntParam), routes.go (7 new routes),
  timeline.templ (entityGroupsSection component), .ai.md (updated routes + sprint).

### Timeline Plugin Sprint 6 — Visibility Controls — COMPLETE
- **Per-user visibility filtering**: `canUserView()` helper in service layer evaluates
  base visibility (everyone/dm_only) then JSON `visibility_rules` (allowed_users whitelist
  takes precedence over denied_users blacklist). Owners always see everything.
- **ListTimelines and ListTimelineEvents**: Now filter by per-user visibility rules
  using the userID parameter (previously reserved, now active).
- **EventLink visibility**: `EffectiveVisibility()` and `ParseVisibilityRules()` methods
  on EventLink. `UpdateEventLinkVisibility` service/repo method for per-event overrides.
- **Validation**: `validateVisibilityRules()` checks JSON format on timeline update and
  event visibility update. Visibility override validated against allowed values.
- **MemberLister integration**: Cross-plugin adapter pattern (same as sessions plugin).
  `ListCampaignMembersAPI` returns campaign members for the visibility user selector.
  Non-owner members only shown in selector (owners always see everything).
- **View-as-player integration**: `effectiveRole()` helper checks `layouts.IsViewingAsPlayer`
  context. Index, Show, and TimelineDataAPI handlers use effective role for content
  filtering. Owner in "view as player" mode sees only player-visible timelines/events.
- **Visibility settings UI**: Alpine.js `visibilitySettingsSection` component on timeline
  show page (Owner only). Base visibility dropdown (everyone/dm_only) + per-user
  restrictions: radio toggle (none/only these players/everyone except) with member
  checkboxes. Auto-saves to `PUT /timelines/:tid/visibility` with inline status feedback.
- **Routes**: 3 new Owner-only routes: PUT .../visibility (timeline), PUT .../events/:eid/visibility
  (event link), GET .../members (campaign members for selector).
- **Files**: model.go (ParseVisibilityRules on EventLink, MemberRef, UpdateEventVisibilityInput),
  service.go (canUserView, validateVisibilityRules, filtering in List methods),
  repository.go (UpdateEventLinkVisibility), handler.go (MemberLister, effectiveRole,
  3 new handlers), routes.go (3 new routes), timeline.templ (visibilitySettingsSection,
  visibilityJSON/rulesJSON helpers), app/routes.go (SetMemberLister wiring).

### Timeline Plugin Sprint 7 — @Mentions, Dashboard Block, Polish — COMPLETE
- **Dashboard block**: `timeline_preview` block type for campaign dashboard editor.
  HTMX lazy-loaded from `GET /timelines/preview?limit=N`. Shows timeline cards with
  icon, name, calendar name, event count, and DM-only indicator. Palette entry in
  dashboard_editor.js with configurable limit (1-20).
- **@Mention support**: `TimelineSearcher` cross-plugin interface on entity handler.
  Timeline service `SearchTimelines()` method with LIKE query (name match, role-filtered,
  limit 10). Entity search JSON response appends timeline results when the editor
  @mention widget requests JSON (Accept: application/json). Timelines appear in the
  @mention popup with type "Timeline" and timeline icon/color.
- **Repository search**: `Search()` method on timeline repo with LIKE-based name matching,
  visibility filtering, and calendar name JOIN.
- **Wiring**: `entityHandler.SetTimelineSearcher(timelineSvc)` in app/routes.go.
- **Files**: model.go (no change), service.go (SearchTimelines), repository.go (Search),
  handler.go (PreviewAPI), routes.go (preview route), timeline.templ (timelinePreviewFragment),
  campaigns/model.go (BlockTimelinePreview), campaigns/dashboard_blocks.templ
  (dashTimelinePreview), entities/handler.go (TimelineSearcher interface, SearchAPI merge),
  dashboard_editor.js (palette + config), app/routes.go (wiring).

### All 7 Timeline Plugin Sprints Complete
The timeline plugin is now fully implemented with all planned features:
- Sprint 1: Core infrastructure (CRUD, migration, sidebar, list/show pages)
- Sprint 2: Calendar event linking (link/unlink UI, event picker, bulk link)
- Sprint 3: Interactive D3.js visualization (zoom, pan, drag, tooltips)
- Sprint 4: Zoom levels and search (era→day visual styles, search/filter bar)
- Sprint 5: Entity groups and swim-lanes
- Sprint 6: Visibility controls (per-user JSON rules, view-as-player)
- Sprint 7: @Mentions, dashboard block, polish

## Competitive Analysis & Roadmap
Created `.ai/roadmap.md` with comprehensive comparison vs WorldAnvil, Kanka, and
LegendKeeper. Key findings:
- Chronicle is ahead on page layout editor, dashboards, self-hosting, and modern stack
- Critical gaps: Quick Search (Ctrl+K), entity hierarchy, calendar, maps, inline secrets
- Calendar is identified as a DIRE NEED — Kanka's is the gold standard
- API technical documentation needed for Foundry VTT integration
- Foundry VTT module planned in phases: notes sync → calendar sync → actor sync
- Features organized by tier: Core, Plugin, Module, Widget, External
- Revised priority phases: D (complete) → E (UX) → F (calendar/time) → G (maps) →
  H (secrets) → I (integrations) → J (visualization) → K (delight)

## Next Session Should
1. **Foundry sync Phase 5:** Shop entity type (inventory relations, Foundry drag-and-drop widget).
2. **Foundry sync testing:** End-to-end verification of WebSocket event flow and API endpoints.
3. **Permission hardening:** RequireAddon middleware on API routes, sync permission audit.
4. **Extension documentation:** `.ai.md` for websocket, syncapi, maps drawing subsystem.
5. **Alpha-critical:** Extension technical documentation (1-3 page `.ai.md` per plugin/widget).

## Known Issues Right Now
- `make dev` requires `air` to be installed (`go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest`)
- Templ generated files (`*_templ.go`) are gitignored, so `templ generate`
  must run before build on a fresh clone
- Tailwind CSS output (`static/css/app.css`) is gitignored, needs `make tailwind`
- Tailwind standalone CLI (`tailwindcss`) is v3; do NOT use `npx @tailwindcss/cli` (v4 syntax)

## Completed Phases
- **2026-02-19: Phase 0** — Project scaffolding, AI docs, build config
- **2026-02-19: Phase 1** — Auth, campaigns, SMTP, admin, entities, editor, UI layouts,
  unit tests, Dockerfile, CI/CD, production deployment, auto-migrations
- **2026-02-19 to 2026-02-20: Phase 2** — Media plugin, security audit (14 fixes),
  dynamic sidebar, entity images, sidebar customization, layout builder, entity type
  config/color picker, public campaigns, visual template editor, dark mode, tags,
  audit logging, site settings, tag picker, @mentions, entity tooltips, relations,
  entity type CRUD, visual polish, semantic color system, notifications, modules page,
  attributes widget, editor view/edit toggle, entity list redesign
- **2026-02-20: Phase 3** — Competitor-inspired UI overhaul: Page/Category rename,
  drill-down sidebar, category dashboards, tighter cards
- **2026-02-20: Phase B** — Discover page split, template editor block resizing &
  visibility, field overrides, extension framework (addons), sync API plugin with
  admin/owner dashboards, REST API v1 endpoints (read/write/sync)
- **2026-02-20: Phase C** — Player notes widget, terminology standardization
- **2026-02-22 to 2026-02-24: Phase D** — Customization Hub (sidebar config, custom
  nav, dashboard editor, category dashboards, page layouts tab), Player Notes Overhaul
  (shared notes, edit locking, version history, rich text), Sprint 5 polish (hx-boost
  sidebar, widget lifecycle, "view as player" toggle)
