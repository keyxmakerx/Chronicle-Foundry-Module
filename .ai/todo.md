## 1. Bugfixes & Problems

Known broken or missing things, ordered by severity.

### Critical

- [x] **Public campaign widget 403s** — Editor and attributes widgets return 403 for non-member visitors on public campaigns. Root cause: GET `/entry`, `/fields`, `/tags`, `/relations` only registered in authenticated route group, not in public-capable group. Fixed by adding routes to `pub` group in entities/routes.go, tags/routes.go, relations/routes.go.

### High

- [ ] **Image upload click does nothing** — Users click "Add Image" area, nothing happens. Widget code (`image_upload.js`) appears correct; likely browser-level issue (Firefox blocking programmatic file input `.click()`) or widget not mounting. Needs browser-level debugging with DevTools.
- [ ] **No media management for campaign owners** — Admin has `/admin/storage` page. Campaign owners have NO way to browse, manage, or delete their uploads. Need campaign-scoped media browser at `/campaigns/:id/media` with "referenced by" tracking, delete with warnings, and upload from browser page.

### Medium

- [ ] **Tags not hideable from players** — All tags visible to all campaign members. No per-tag visibility field. Need `dm_only` visibility option so GMs can create tags players shouldn't see (e.g., "Plot Hook", "Deceased").
- [ ] **Attributes missing "Use Template" reset** — Entity types define field templates, entities can override with `FieldOverrides`. But no UI to reset overrides back to type defaults. Especially painful when entity type fields are updated — old entities don't get new fields automatically.

### Low

- [ ] **API endpoints ignore addon disabled state** — Routes are hardcoded at startup. If calendar addon is disabled for a campaign, `/api/v1/campaigns/:id/calendar` still executes. Need `RequireAddon` middleware on API route groups.
- [ ] **API technical documentation missing** — REST API v1 exists and works but has no public documentation (OpenAPI spec or reference).
- [ ] **Calendar HTMX detection inconsistency** — `internal/plugins/calendar/handler.go` uses raw `c.Request().Header.Get("HX-Request")` in 5 places instead of centralized `middleware.IsHTMX(c)`. Should standardize.
- [ ] **Cross-plugin adapter interface duplication** — `MemberLister` interface duplicated in timeline and sessions plugins. Should extract to shared package.
- [ ] **IDOR check functions duplicated** — `requireTimelineInCampaign`, `requireMapInCampaign`, `requireSessionInCampaign`, `requireEventInCampaign` follow identical patterns in 4 plugins. Extract to shared generic helper.
- [ ] **logAudit fire-and-forget duplicated** — Similar audit logging patterns in entities, campaigns, tags handlers. Could extract to shared `FireAudit()` utility.
- [ ] **JS fetch header setup duplicated** — CSRF + JSON header construction repeated in notes, relations, tag_picker, attributes. Add `Chronicle.apiFetch()` wrapper to boot.js.
- [ ] **Mixed error types** — `echo.NewHTTPError` used directly in 30+ places instead of centralized `apperror` package. Should standardize.
- [ ] **LIKE metacharacter in backlinks** — `entities/repository.go:1011` concatenates entityID into LIKE pattern without escaping `%`/`_`. Low risk (UUIDs only) but should escape for safety.
- [ ] **No Content Security Policy headers** — CSP not implemented. Would provide XSS defense-in-depth alongside bluemonday sanitization.
- [ ] **No input size validation on text fields** — Relies on DB column limits. Handler-level validation (name max 200, description max 5000, etc.) would be better.
- [ ] **Package-level Go doc comments missing** — ~80% of .go files lack `// Package ...` comments (handler.go, service.go, repository.go, routes.go across all plugins).
- [ ] **Missing JS widget .ai.md docs** — 11 widget files + 6 core JS files lack documentation. Priority: editor.js, attributes.js, tag_picker.js, relations.js, notes.js.

## 2. Features To Do

New capabilities ordered by priority for alpha release.

### Alpha-Critical (Must Have)

- [ ] **Media management for owners + admins** — Campaign-scoped media browser: grid/list view, "referenced by" queries, delete with entity reference warnings, upload from browser page. Admin view spans all campaigns.
- [ ] **Tag visibility controls** — Per-tag `dm_only` flag. Migration for new column. Filter in repo/handler. Respect in tag_picker.js widget. Player role should not see DM-only tags.
- [ ] **Attributes template reset** — "Reset to Type Template" button in attributes customize panel. Clear `field_overrides`, restore type-level defaults.
- [ ] **Extension technical documentation** — 1-3 page `.ai.md` writeup per plugin/widget/module. Standard template covering purpose, architecture, API endpoints, widget integration, lifecycle, security. See documentation audit in plan.
- [ ] **Graceful extension degradation** — `RequireAddon` API middleware, human-readable errors for disabled/uninstalled addons, addon dependency checking.

### Alpha-Nice-to-Have

- [ ] **File security audit + ClamAV** — Add ClamAV container to docker-compose, scan uploads before storage, configurable file type allowlist, SVG blocking (XSS vector).
- [ ] **API documentation** — OpenAPI 3.0 spec or handwritten reference for REST v1. Auth guide, endpoint reference, rate limiting docs, sync protocol.
- [ ] **Maps Phase 2** — Layers, marker groups, privacy controls, nested maps (world → continent → city).
- [ ] **Timeline Phase 2B** — Event connections (visual lines between related events), create-from-timeline modal, beautification pass.
- [ ] **Campaign export/import** — JSON bundle for backup/migration. Media as separate zip or URL references.

### Post-Alpha

- [ ] Per-entity permissions (view/edit per role/user)
- [ ] Group-based visibility (beyond everyone/dm_only)
- [ ] Foundry VTT sync module Phase 1 (notes/journal sync)
- [ ] Foundry VTT sync module Phase 2 (calendar sync)
- [ ] Relations graph visualization widget (D3.js/Cytoscape.js)
- [ ] Dice roller widget (floating panel, expression parser)
- [ ] Entity sub-notes/posts (sub-documents with separate visibility)
- [ ] Auto-linking in editor (LegendKeeper-style entity name detection)
- [ ] Guided worldbuilding prompts per entity type (WorldAnvil-style)
- [ ] Role-aware dashboards (different views per campaign role)
- [ ] Entity type template library (genre presets for new campaigns)
- [ ] Saved filters / smart lists (filter presets as sidebar links)
- [ ] Bulk entity operations (multi-select for batch tag/move/delete)
- [ ] Whiteboards / freeform canvas (Tldraw/Excalidraw)
- [ ] Persistent filters per category (localStorage)
- [ ] 2FA/TOTP support
- [ ] Invite system (email invitations for campaigns)
- [ ] Webhook support for external event notifications

### Testing (High Priority)

- [x] Entity service unit tests (40 tests passing)
- [x] Sync API service tests (31 tests)
- [x] Addons service tests (32 tests)
- [x] Auth service tests (26 tests)
- [x] Notes widget service tests (28 tests)
- [x] Widget lifecycle audit (destroy methods, event listener leaks)
- [ ] Campaigns service tests (HIGHEST PRIORITY — most critical untested code)
- [ ] Relations service tests (bi-directional create/delete, validation)
- [ ] Tags service tests (CRUD, slug generation, diff-based assignment)
- [ ] Audit service tests (pagination, validation, fire-and-forget)
- [ ] Media service tests (file validation, thumbnail generation)
- [ ] Settings service tests (limit resolution, override priority)
- [ ] HTMX fragment edge cases (CSRF propagation, double-init, nested targets)

### Game System Modules

- [ ] D&D 5e module (SRD reference data, tooltips, pages)
- [ ] Pathfinder 2e module
- [ ] Draw Steel module

### Infrastructure

- [ ] **Add golangci-lint to CI pipeline** — Currently only `go vet` + unit tests run in CI. golangci-lint catches real bugs (unchecked errors, dead code) and should be enforced.
- [ ] **Add security scanning to CI** — gosec (static analysis) and govulncheck (dependency vulnerabilities) should run in CI. Requires Go 1.25+ for latest gosec.
- [ ] **Increase test coverage** — Currently 5.3% (6 test files). Priority: campaigns service tests, relations service tests, tags service tests, media service tests, then handler tests.
- [ ] docker-compose.yml full stack verification (app + MariaDB + Redis)
- [ ] `air` hot reload setup for dev workflow

## 3. Competitive Analysis

Summary of strengths/weaknesses for strategic positioning. Full analysis in `.ai/roadmap.md`.

| Platform | Users | Key Strengths | Key Weaknesses | What Chronicle Should Learn |
|----------|-------|--------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **WorldAnvil** | ~1.5M | 25+ templates, guided prompts, inline secrets, Chronicles (map+timeline combo), 45+ RPG systems, family trees | BBCode editor, steep learning curve, cluttered UI, aggressive paywall, privacy requires paid | Guided prompts, deep secrets system, RPG system breadth |
| **Kanka** | ~300K | Structured 20-type entities, generous free tier, deep per-role/user permissions, best calendar (-2B to +2B years), GPL source, REST API, marketplace | Summernote editor, complex permission UI, self-hosted deprioritized | Permission granularity, calendar depth, marketplace concept |
| **LegendKeeper** | Small | Best WebGL maps (regions, navigation), real-time co-editing, auto-linking, offline-first, clean UI, speed as brand | Limited entity types, no formal relations, minimal game systems | Auto-linking magic, speed obsession, map interaction depth |
| **Obsidian** | ~4M+ | Local-first markdown, 1000+ plugins, graph view, backlinks, community themes, offline, privacy by default, canvas/whiteboard | Not TTRPG-specific, no calendar/maps/timeline natively (requires plugin cobbling), single-user (no campaign sharing), no web UI | Plugin ecosystem model, graph visualization, local-first philosophy, community extensibility |

### Where Chronicle Already Wins

1. **Drag-and-drop page layout editor** — nobody else has visual page design
2. **Customizable dashboards** (campaign + per-category) — most flexible dashboard system
3. **Self-hosted as primary target** — no paywall, no forced public content
4. **Modern tech stack** — TipTap + HTMX + Templ vs BBCode/Summernote
5. **Per-entity field overrides** — unique; entities customize their own schema
6. **REST API from day one** — matches Kanka, beats WorldAnvil and LegendKeeper
7. **Extension framework** — per-campaign addon toggle
8. **Audit logging** — no competitor has this
9. **Interactive D3 timeline** with eras, clustering, minimap — exceeds Kanka, matches WorldAnvil

### Chronicle vs Obsidian

- Obsidian users cobble TTRPG workflows from community plugins (Fantasy Calendar, Leaflet, TTRPG plugin). Chronicle offers purpose-built calendar/maps/timelines/entity types as first-class features.
- Chronicle has multi-user campaign sharing built-in; Obsidian is single-user.
- Obsidian's plugin ecosystem (1000+) is aspirational — Chronicle's addon system is the foundation for similar extensibility.
