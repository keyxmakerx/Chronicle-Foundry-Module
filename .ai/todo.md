## 1. Bugfixes & Problems

Known broken or missing things, ordered by severity.

### Critical

- [x] **Public campaign widget 403s** — Editor and attributes widgets return 403 for non-member visitors on public campaigns. Root cause: GET `/entry`, `/fields`, `/tags`, `/relations` only registered in authenticated route group, not in public-capable group. Fixed by adding routes to `pub` group in entities/routes.go, tags/routes.go, relations/routes.go.

### High

- [x] **@mention popup won't dismiss** — Fixed by adding link mark guard in `onUpdate` (skips `@` inside existing mention links) and removing `selectionUpdate` event binding. Mentions still stored as Link marks, but popup no longer re-triggers.
- [x] **Image upload click does nothing** — Fixed event recursion: file input's click event bubbled back to parent widget, causing Firefox to suppress file picker. Added stopPropagation on file input click, campaign_id to upload FormData, and fixed hover feedback on placeholder.
- [x] **No media management for campaign owners** — Fixed: campaign-scoped media browser at `/campaigns/:id/media` (Owner-only). Grid view with thumbnails, "referenced by" tracking (queries entities by image_path and entry_html), delete with confirmation warnings, upload from browser page (Alpine.js), pagination, storage stats header. Sidebar "Media" link in Manage section.
- [x] **Sidebar drill 403 for public visitors** — Fixed: added `GET /campaigns/:id/sidebar/drill/:slug` to `pub` group in `campaigns/routes.go`. Public visitors can now click categories in sidebar without 403.
- [x] **Timeline eras not editable** — Fixed: added "Edit Eras" button on timeline detail page (links to `/calendar/settings?tab=eras`). Calendar settings now reads `?tab` query param to open correct tab. Added confirmation dialog to era delete button.
- [x] **Sessions addon not discoverable** — Fixed: added Sessions cross-link in calendar header (dice icon). When Sessions addon enabled, links to sessions page. When disabled, owners see dimmed icon linking to addon settings. Users on Calendar can now discover Sessions naturally.
- [x] **Calendar events lack view→edit mode** — Fixed: added read-only event detail modal (`eventViewModal`) showing name, date, time, category, visibility, description, and entity link. Scribes see "Edit" button that transitions to edit modal. All users can click event chips to view details.
- [x] **Calendar click-to-create on date** — Fixed: entire date cell is clickable for Scribes+ (cursor-pointer, hover highlight). Clicks on empty space open create modal with date pre-filled. Event chip clicks are properly intercepted.
- [x] **No unsaved changes warning** — Fixed: global dirty state tracker in boot.js (`Chronicle.markDirty/markClean/isDirty`) with `beforeunload` handler. Editor widget hooks in. Forms with `data-track-changes` auto-tracked (entity create/edit, campaign create/settings).
- [x] **Empty states inconsistent** — Fixed: added empty states to campaign members, admin campaigns, admin users, admin modules. Fixed entity_types.templ if/else structure. Calendar `UpcomingEventsEmpty()` was already good. Maps/timelines already have empty states.
- [x] **Calendar event categories not customizable** — Fixed: added `calendar_event_categories` table (migration 000039) with slug/name/icon/color per calendar. Default categories seeded on creation. Categories tab in calendar settings for full CRUD. Event modal dropdown and categoryIcon() now dynamic. JS view modal uses categories data attribute for display.

### Medium

- [x] **Tags not hideable from players** — Implemented `dm_only` column (migration 000038), role-based filtering in repo/service/handler, eye-slash badge + DM checkbox in tag_picker.js.
- [x] **Attributes missing "Use Template" reset** — Added DELETE `/field-overrides` endpoint and "Reset" button in attributes customize panel with confirmation dialog. Clears field_overrides to NULL, restoring category template defaults.
- [x] **Search scope limited to entities** — Fixed: Ctrl+K now searches entities, timelines, maps, calendar events, and sessions. Added MapSearcher, CalendarSearcher, SessionSearcher interfaces following the TimelineSearcher pattern. Each plugin implements Search repo method + formats results. Wired in routes.go.
- [x] **No confirmation dialogs for destructive actions** — Audited all delete operations. Most already had confirms (campaigns, entities, maps, markers, timelines, sessions, calendar events, sidebar nav, admin pages). Added confirms to notes.js and relations.js (the two missing ones). Dashboard editor row/block delete is safe (not persisted until explicit save).
- [x] **No loading/spinner states** — Fixed: added HTMX loading indicator (3px accent-colored progress bar at top of viewport). CSS animation in input.css, request tracking in boot.js, indicator div in app.templ layout. Tracks concurrent requests, only hides when all complete.
- [x] **Keyboard shortcuts help** — Fixed: press `?` to open shortcuts help overlay showing all 4 global shortcuts (Ctrl+K/N/E/S). Closes with `?`, Escape, or clicking outside. Mac-aware (shows ⌘ vs Ctrl).
- [x] **Form validation feedback** — Fixed: added `:user-invalid` and `.input-error` CSS for red borders on invalid fields. JS in boot.js listens for `invalid` events and inserts `.field-error` inline hints with the browser's validation message. Errors clear on input.
- [x] **Mobile sidebar toggle** — Already implemented: hamburger button in topbar (md:hidden), Alpine.js sidebarOpen state, CSS translate slide-in animation, backdrop overlay, auto-close on navigation.
- [x] **Calendar recurring events limited** — Sessions now support weekly/biweekly/monthly/custom recurrence. Calendar events still yearly-only (separate concern). Session recurrence via migration 000041.
- [x] **Editor lacks table support** — Added TipTap table extensions (Table, TableRow, TableCell, TableHeader), insert menu entry, CSS styles, rebuilt vendor bundle via esbuild.
- [x] **Editor lacks callout/highlight blocks** — Fixed: blockquote restyled as callout block with accent border, subtle background, info icon. Insert menu renamed "Blockquote" → "Callout Block". Read-only prose views also styled. TipTap bundle limits prevent custom node types; blockquote serves as callout.
- [x] **Entity cloning** — Fixed: Clone button on entity show page (Scribe+). POST creates copy with "(Copy)" suffix, clones entry, image, fields, field overrides, popup config, tags via INSERT...SELECT. Redirects to edit page. Does NOT copy relations.
- [x] **Map marker search** — Fixed: added search input in map header. Client-side filtering dims non-matching markers (opacity 0.15). Enter pans to first match and opens tooltip. Searches name and description.
- [x] **Timeline event creation from timeline page** — Already implemented: "Create Event" button in header opens modal with full form (name, date, description, category, visibility, color, multi-day, recurrence). POST to standalone-events API.

### Low (Original)

_See `.ai/audit.md` for the full feature parity & completeness audit. Audit items now organized into Phases M0-M3 and Backlog below._

- [x] **API endpoints ignore addon disabled state** — RequireAddon middleware gates calendar, maps, sessions, timeline routes. RequireAddonAPI middleware gates API v1 routes (syncapi). Fail-closed on DB errors.
- [x] **API technical documentation missing** — Created OpenAPI 3.0.3 spec at `docs/api/openapi.yaml` with 63 endpoints, 42 schemas, auth details, and error responses.
- [x] **Calendar HTMX detection inconsistency** — Replaced 5 raw `HX-Request` header checks in calendar handler with `middleware.IsHTMX(c)`, which also checks `HX-Boosted` to avoid returning fragments on boosted navigation.
- [x] **Cross-plugin adapter interface duplication** — Extracted `campaigns.MemberLister` interface. Timeline and sessions handlers now import it instead of defining local copies.
- [x] **IDOR check functions duplicated** — Extracted generic `middleware.RequireInCampaign[T]()` helper with Go generics. Updated maps, timeline, sessions handlers. Calendar/markers left as-is (parent traversal needed).
- [x] **logAudit fire-and-forget duplicated** — Assessed: three plugins use different logAudit signatures (entities: entityID+name, campaigns: details map, tags: tagName). Not worth abstracting — left as-is.
- [x] **JS fetch header setup duplicated** — Added `Chronicle.apiFetch()` wrapper to boot.js (auto-sets headers, CSRF, JSON serialization). Migrated sidebar_config, entity_type_config, sidebar_nav_editor, dashboard_editor widgets. Simplified notes.js CSRF reading.
- [x] **Mixed error types** — Replaced all 249 `echo.NewHTTPError` calls with `apperror` domain errors across 15 handler files + middleware + websocket. Zero remaining.
- [x] **LIKE metacharacter in backlinks** — Added `strings.NewReplacer` to escape `%` and `_` in entityID before LIKE pattern in `entities/repository.go:FindBacklinks`.
- [x] **No Content Security Policy headers** — CSP implemented in `middleware/security.go` (default-src 'self', script-src, style-src, img-src, font-src, connect-src, frame-ancestors, base-uri, form-action). Alpine.js requires 'unsafe-inline'/'unsafe-eval'; documented tradeoff.
- [x] **No input size validation on text fields** — Added `apperror/validate.go` helpers (ValidateStringLength, ValidateRequired) and wired into entities, campaigns, maps, timeline, sessions create handlers.
- [x] **Package-level Go doc comments** — All Go packages have `// Package ...` comments. Added `doc.go` for `templates/components`. Widget "packages" are JS-only (`.ai.md` docs).
- [x] **Missing JS widget .ai.md docs** — All done: image_upload, timeline_viz, dashboard_editor, template_editor, entity_tooltip, foundry-module, websocket, attributes, mentions, title, boot.js, editor, tags. Relations and notes already existed.

---

Permissions widget updated with group grants section. `visibilityFilter()` SQL updated for group membership check. Settings page "Groups" link. 7 unit tests.
- [x] **Sprint K-4: Auto-Linking in Editor** — Entity names API (`GET /entity-names`) with Redis caching (5-min TTL). `ListNames` repository method sorted by name length DESC. Auto-link JS module (`editor_autolink.js`) scans text nodes for entity names, creates @mention links. Insert menu item + Ctrl+Shift+L shortcut. Whole-word, case-insensitive, min 3 chars, skips existing links.
- [x] **Sprint K-5: Relations Graph Visualization** — D3.js force-directed graph (`relation_graph.js`) with dynamic CDN loading, zoom/pan, drag, node coloring, tooltips, legend. Backend: `ListByCampaign` repo (dedup bi-directional), `GetGraphData` service, `GraphAPI`/`GraphPage` handlers. Dashboard block `relations_graph` with configurable height.

Connection status UI (event-driven onStateChange, click-to-reconnect, activity flash). SimpleCalendar CRUD hooks (journal hook listeners, SC flag detection, calendar event push).

### Phase L: Content Depth & Editor Power

- [x] **Sprint L-1: Entity Sub-Notes (Posts) UI** — Migration 000050 (`entity_posts` table). Full posts widget: PostRepository (CRUD + reorder), PostService (validation, sort order), Handler (list/create/update/delete/reorder). JS widget (`entity_posts.js`) with collapsible post cards, drag-to-reorder, visibility toggle, inline rename, delete confirmation. Integrated into entity show page.

### Phase M0: Data Integrity & Export Completeness ← START HERE

_Fix export/import so backups don't lose data. Highest-priority work._

- [ ] **Sprint M0-1: Export Adapters — Permissions, Groups, Posts** — Add EntityPermission export adapter (entity_permissions table), CampaignGroup + CampaignGroupMember export adapter, EntityPost export adapter. Update import service with corresponding import handlers. Extend import_test.go.
- [ ] **Sprint M0-2: Export Adapters — Timeline & Sessions** — Wire ExportTimelines() to call ListConnections() (type exists, never populated). Wire ExportEntityGroup adapter to call ListEntityGroups(). Add SessionAttendee export adapter.
- [ ] **Sprint M0-3: Import Parent Hierarchy Fix** — Fix entity parent reimport: second-pass currently only handles entry/image, not parent_id. Add parent_id resolution via ParentSlug. Test round-trip.
- [ ] **Sprint M0-4: Relations Visibility Controls** — Add `dm_only` column to entity_relations (migration 000052). Update model/repo/service/handler. Update relations.js widget with DM-only toggle. Update export adapter.

### Phase M1: Quick Wins Sprint

_High-impact, low-effort items that immediately improve the user experience._

- [ ] **Sprint M1-1: Account & Settings Quick Wins** — Export/Import button on campaign settings page (handler exists, needs UI). In-app password change form + handler. Display name editing on account page. Theme preference persistence (save to user settings).
- [ ] **Sprint M1-2: Entity List & Sidebar Quick Wins** — Entity list sort controls (name/date/type dropdown + localStorage). Entity favorites/bookmarks (star icon, localStorage sidebar section). Notes search/filter (client-side on titles). Calendar event search/filter (like map marker search).
- [ ] **Sprint M1-3: Session & Member Quick Wins** — Session recap field (migration + model + UI). Member removal confirmation dialog. Avatar upload UI (handler + account page). Character assignment (character_entity_id on campaign_members + UI picker).

### Phase M2: JS Code Quality

_Consistency and reliability across all JS widgets._

- [ ] **Sprint M2-1: apiFetch Migration & Utility Dedup** — Migrate notes.js (10), attributes.js (5), relations.js (6), tag_picker.js (6), permissions.js (2), editor.js (2) to Chronicle.apiFetch(). Remove local escHtml/escAttr from groups.js and relation_graph.js. Remove local apiFetch from groups.js.
- [ ] **Sprint M2-2: Error Handling — Toast on Failure** — Add toast feedback to notes.js, tag_picker.js, timeline_viz.js, entity_tooltip.js, editor_autolink.js, editor_mention.js, template_editor.js, relation_graph.js, search_modal.js. All catch blocks show Chronicle.toast() instead of console.error alone.

### Phase M3: Test Coverage

_Fill the biggest test gaps — zero-test plugins and incomplete service tests._

- [ ] **Sprint M3-1: Maps Service Tests** — 27+ endpoints, 0 tests. Mock MapRepository, test service CRUD for maps, markers, layers, drawings, tokens, fog. Target: 40+ tests.
- [ ] **Sprint M3-2: Sessions & Calendar Service Tests** — Sessions: 8+ endpoints, 0 tests. Calendar: extend beyond day/week domain tests. Target: 20+ each.
- [ ] **Sprint M3-3: Timeline Service Tests & CI Fix** — Extend beyond 3 connection tests. Fix CI `-short` flag (add testing.Short() skips or remove flag). Target: 15+ tests.

### Phase M: Game System Modules & Worldbuilding Tools

- [ ] **Sprint M-1: D&D 5e Module — Data & Tooltip API** — SRD-legal JSON (spells, monsters, items, conditions, classes, races). Tooltip endpoint. Wire into entity_tooltip widget. Register as addon.
- [ ] **Sprint M-2: D&D 5e Module — Reference Pages** — Browsable pages at `/modules/dnd5e/`. Category cards, searchable lists, formatted stat block detail pages. Quick-search integration.
- [ ] **Sprint M-3: Pathfinder 2e Module** — ORC-licensed data following D&D 5e pattern. Spells, monsters, ancestries, classes, conditions, feats.
- [ ] **Sprint M-4: Guided Worldbuilding Prompts** — `worldbuilding_prompts` table. "Writing Prompts" collapsible panel on entity edit page. Default prompt packs per entity type. Owner-customizable.
- [ ] **Sprint M-5: Entity Type Template Library** — Genre presets (fantasy, sci-fi, horror, modern, historical) as JSON fixtures. Campaign creation genre selection. "Import preset" in Customization Hub.

### Phase N: Collaboration & Platform Maturity

- [ ] **Sprint N-1: Role-Aware Dashboards** — Role-keyed dashboard layouts. Dashboard editor gains role selector. Players see role-specific dashboard or default fallback.
- [ ] **Sprint N-2: Invite System** — Migration: `campaign_invites` table. Email invitations with one-click accept link. Non-public campaigns require invitation. Invite management UI.
- [ ] **Sprint N-3: 2FA/TOTP Support** — TOTP enrollment with QR code (`pquerna/otp`). Login redirect to TOTP input. Recovery codes (8 hashed). Admin force-disable.
- [ ] **Sprint N-4: Accessibility Audit (WCAG 2.1 AA)** — ARIA labels, focus traps, skip-to-content, color contrast 4.5:1, keyboard nav, screen reader announcements, axe-core scanning.

- [ ] **Sprint O-2: Map Drawing Tools** — Leaflet.Draw integration (freehand, polygons, circles, rectangles, text). Uses existing `map_drawings` table. Per-drawing visibility, color/opacity.
- [ ] **Sprint O-3: Discord Bot Integration** — Plugin at `internal/plugins/discord/`. Bot token config. Webhook session notifications. Reaction-based RSVP per ADR-012.
- [ ] **Sprint O-4: Bulk Operations & Persistent Filters** — Multi-select entity lists with batch actions (tag, move, visibility, delete). Persistent filters per category in localStorage.
- [ ] **Sprint O-5: Editor Import/Export & Additional Themes** — Markdown import/export via `goldmark`. Sepia + high-contrast themes. Custom accent color picker.

### Backlog: Remaining Audit Items (address opportunistically)

_Lower-priority items to pick up during related sprints or as standalone tasks._

**UI Consistency:**
- [ ] **Alert styling inconsistent** — login.templ and entities/form.templ use inline Tailwind instead of alert-success/alert-error classes.
- [ ] **Admin pagination inline** — admin/users.templ and admin/campaigns.templ have hand-rolled pagination instead of using components.Pagination.
- [ ] **Modal approach mixed** — Sessions uses dialog element; calendar/other modals use Alpine.js. Should standardize.
- [ ] **Rate limiting on mutations** — Campaign/entity/widget mutation endpoints have no rate limiting (auth + media do).
- [ ] **Recurring calendar events (beyond yearly)** — Sessions support weekly/biweekly/monthly, but calendar events only support yearly.

**Documentation:**
- [ ] **Posts widget missing .ai.md** — Only Go widget without documentation file.
- [ ] **16 JS widgets missing .ai.md** — calendar_widget, map_widget, relation_graph, entity_type_config, entity_type_editor, groups, permissions, shop_inventory, sidebar_config, timeline_widget, entity_posts, recent_entities, notifications, shortcuts_help, editor_autolink, editor_secret.

**Player & DM Experience Gaps:**
- [ ] **Entity tag/field filtering** — Entity list only has type tabs. No filter by tag, custom field value, or visibility mode.
- [ ] **Entity print/PDF export** — No per-entity print stylesheet or PDF generation.
- [ ] **Share link for entities** — Campaign-level public mode exists but no per-entity shareable links.
- [ ] **Soft delete / entity archive** — Entities are hard-deleted only. Add `archived_at` column or trash/recycle bin pattern.
- [ ] **Map measurement tool** — Can't measure distance between markers. Leaflet supports this via plugins.
- [ ] **Map fog of war native UI** — Backend exists for Foundry sync but no Chronicle-native fog controls.
- [ ] **Initiative tracker** — No combat ordering tool for session management.
- [ ] **Session prep checklist** — No per-session task list for DM prep items.
- [ ] **NPC quick generator** — Random name/trait generator for improvisation.
- [ ] **Account deletion** — No self-service account removal option.
- [ ] **Member activity tracking** — No last-seen, activity feed, or engagement metrics.
- [ ] **Timeline search/filter** — No search within timeline events by name/text.
- [ ] **Timeline zoom-to-era** — No button to jump viewport to a specific era.
- [ ] **Entity version history UI** — Audit log exists but no "view diff / restore version" for entities.
- [ ] **Toast notification grouping** — Duplicate toasts stack separately instead of grouping.
- [ ] **Entity image gallery** — Only one image per entity; no carousel/gallery for multiple images.

### Deferred to Phase P+ (or community contributions)

- [ ] Draw Steel module
- [ ] Whiteboards / freeform canvas (Tldraw/Excalidraw)
- [ ] Offline mode / service worker caching
- [ ] Collaborative editing presence indicators
- [ ] Calendar timezone support / print-PDF export
- [ ] Map hex/square grid overlay
- [x] Fog of war bidirectional sync (Chronicle ↔ Foundry)
- [ ] Webhook support for external event notifications
- [ ] Widget inline CSS → CSS classes migration
- [ ] Reusable modal/dropdown component library
- [ ] Dice roller widget
- [ ] Encounter difficulty calculator
- [ ] Family tree / genealogy builder
- [ ] Cross-campaign search
- [ ] Mobile-optimized modals (full-screen on small screens)

## 3. Competitive Analysis

Summary of strengths/weaknesses for strategic positioning. Full analysis in `.ai/roadmap.md`.

| Platform | Users | Key Strengths | Key Weaknesses | What Chronicle Should Learn |
|----------|-------|--------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **WorldAnvil** | ~1.5M | 25+ templates, guided prompts, inline secrets, Chronicles (map+timeline combo), 45+ RPG systems, family trees | BBCode editor, steep learning curve, cluttered UI, aggressive paywall, privacy requires paid | Guided prompts, deep secrets system, RPG system breadth |
| **Kanka** | ~300K | Structured 20-type entities, generous free tier, deep per-role/user permissions, best calendar (-2B to +2B years), GPL source, REST API, marketplace | Summernote editor, complex permission UI, self-hosted deprioritized | Permission granularity, calendar depth, marketplace concept |
| **LegendKeeper** | Small | Best WebGL maps (regions, navigation), real-time co-editing, auto-linking, offline-first, clean UI, speed as brand | Limited entity types, no formal relations, minimal game systems | Auto-linking magic, speed obsession, map interaction depth |
| **Obsidian** | ~4M+ | Local-first markdown, 1000+ plugins, graph view, backlinks, community themes, offline, privacy by default, canvas/whiteboard | Not TTRPG-specific, no calendar/maps/timeline natively (requires plugin cobbling), single-user (no campaign sharing), no web UI | Plugin ecosystem model, graph visualization, local-first philosophy, community extensibility |

### Where Chronicle Already Wins

1. **Drag-and-drop page layout editor** — nobody else has visual page design
2. **Customizable dashboards** (campaign + per-category) — most flexible dashboard system
3. **Self-hosted as primary target** — no paywall, no forced public content
4. **Modern tech stack** — TipTap + HTMX + Templ vs BBCode/Summernote
5. **Per-entity field overrides** — unique; entities customize their own schema
6. **REST API from day one** — matches Kanka, beats WorldAnvil and LegendKeeper
7. **Extension framework** — per-campaign addon toggle
8. **Audit logging** — no competitor has this
9. **Interactive D3 timeline** with eras, clustering, minimap — exceeds Kanka, matches WorldAnvil

### Chronicle vs Obsidian

- Obsidian users cobble TTRPG workflows from community plugins (Fantasy Calendar, Leaflet, TTRPG plugin). Chronicle offers purpose-built calendar/maps/timelines/entity types as first-class features.
- Chronicle has multi-user campaign sharing built-in; Obsidian is single-user.
- Obsidian's plugin ecosystem (1000+) is aspirational — Chronicle's addon system is the foundation for similar extensibility.
